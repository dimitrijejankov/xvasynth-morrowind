FormID: 0002AB84	DispositionBlockers	INFOGENERAL	0	I see no reason to talk to you.	
FormID: 0002AB85	DispositionBlockers	INFOGENERAL	0	I don't like you and don't want to talk to you.	
FormID: 0002AB86	DispositionBlockers	INFOGENERAL	0	I'm not listening to you. It's because I don't like you.	
FormID: 0002AB8B	DispositionBlockers	INFOGENERAL	0	You're still speaking. Stop.	
FormID: 00062349	BladesConvSystem	INFOGENERAL	0	At least now we have a name to put to our enemy. Mankar Camoran and the Mythic Dawn will pay for their foul crimes.	
FormID: 0006234A	BladesConvSystem	INFOGENERAL	0	The Mythic Dawn will never take Cloud Ruler Temple. Not while any Blade still draws breath.	
FormID: 0006234B	BladesConvSystem	INFOGENERAL	0	The noose around Bruma is tightening. Now that the Mythic Dawn has learned Martin's location, we have to be prepared for the worst.	
FormID: 0006234C	BladesConvSystem	INFOGENERAL	0	The Battle of Bruma was a great victory! The Mythic Dawn have learned that we are not defenseless.	
FormID: 0006234D	BladesConvSystem	INFOGENERAL	0	Martin Septim will soon claim his rightful place at the head of the Empire, and the Blades will stand beside him.	
FormID: 00062354	BladesConvSystem	INFOGENERAL	0	The Emperor's death was a harsh lesson for all of us. We failed in our duty to the Dragonborn. It must not happen again.	
FormID: 00061381	BladesConvSystem	INFOGENERAL	0	Martin showed himself a true son of the Dragon Blood. But where does that leave us, with no Emperor to serve?	
FormID: 00061382	BladesConvSystem	INFOGENERAL	0	With no Emperor to serve, the Blades now return to our ancient role. We will bide our time until the next Dragonborn arises.	
FormID: 0018B1F5	MQ00	INFOGENERAL	0	Everyone's talking about the assassination, of course. Here. Take my copy of the new Black Horse Courier. Go ahead. Keep it.	
FormID: 000AF060	MQ00	INFOGENERAL	0	Everyone's talking about the victory over Mehrunes Dagon! I can hardly believe that the great Oblivion Crisis is over.	
FormID: 000AF061	MQ00	INFOGENERAL	0	They say that Akatosh appeared and killed Mehrunes Dagon, right in the middle of the Temple of the One! Do you believe it?	
FormID: 000AF062	MQ00	INFOGENERAL	0	I'm glad that the Oblivion Crisis is over, of course, but I can't help wondering... what happens to the Empire now?	slightly worried
FormID: 000AF063	MQ00	INFOGENERAL	0	All the bards are busy composing songs about the battle! [QUOTE]The Fall of Dagon[QUOTE] is my favorite so far.	jovial
FormID: 000AF067	MQ00	INFOGENERAL	0	Have you heard [QUOTE]The Fall of Dagon[QUOTE] yet? [QUOTE]Take heart, the mighty hero cried! He looked up at Dagon and cursed his foul name...[QUOTE]	jovially. the last half is sung -- a ballad or whatever you can think of. It doesn't have to be good, this is Nord/Orc singing after all...
FormID: 000AF068	MQ00	INFOGENERAL	0	All else is put aside to celebrate of our deliverance from evil. Thanks to Akatosh and his servant Martin.	seriously, piously
FormID: 000AF069	MQ00	INFOGENERAL	0	Everyone wants to know what really happened in the Temple. What happened to Martin? Was the fiery dragon really Akatosh?	enthusiastically
FormID: 00034036	DarkConvSystem	INFOGENERAL	0	Have you heard? That big galleon down at the Waterfront? Someone killed the captain! Right there on the ship!	
FormID: 00034037	DarkConvSystem	INFOGENERAL	0	Poor Gromm. I wonder what he'll do now that Baenlin is dead. Serving that old man was the joy of his life, or so I've heard.	
FormID: 00034038	DarkConvSystem	INFOGENERAL	0	Oh, have you heard? Old Baenlin is dead! They say he was murdered! Right in his own home!	
FormID: 00034039	DarkConvSystem	INFOGENERAL	0	Oh, have you heard? About old Baenlin? It was a horrible accident. A stuffed minotaur head fell off the wall and crushed him to death! Tragic...	
FormID: 0003403A	DarkConvSystem	INFOGENERAL	0	Francois Motierre hasn't left his house in days. Hasn't come down to the tavern, refuses to have visitors. I think the man's gone batty.	
FormID: 0003403B	DarkConvSystem	INFOGENERAL	0	You won't believe what's happened! Francois Motierre has been killed! Murdered by the Dark Brotherhood! It's true, I saw the body myself.	
FormID: 0003406D	DarkConvSystem	INFOGENERAL	0	A friend of mine is a member of the Legion. He said some Altmer nobleman was murdered, right here in the city! Faelian, I think his name was.	
FormID: 0003406E	DarkConvSystem	INFOGENERAL	0	They say there are a bunch of people holed up in Summitmist Manor. Locked in. Some kind of weird party or something.	
FormID: 0003406F	DarkConvSystem	INFOGENERAL	0	Everyone in Summitmist Manor is dead! There was some kind of party that went horribly awry, or so I hear.	
FormID: 00034073	DarkConvSystem	INFOGENERAL	0	Have you heard? Adamus Phillida has been killed! Murdered by the Dark Brotherhood!	
FormID: 00034074	DarkConvSystem	INFOGENERAL	0	So, Adamus Phillida is finally retiring from the Imperial Legion. Spent his life fighting the Dark Brotherhood. Time for a well-earned rest, I'd say.	
FormID: 00034075	DarkConvSystem	INFOGENERAL	0	Oh, how horrible! You know Caelia Draconis? That nice Watch officer stationed at the castle? She's been murdered!	REC -- rewrite to say [QUOTE]Watch officer[QUOTE] and not [QUOTE]Legion officer[QUOTE]
FormID: 00034077	DarkConvSystem	INFOGENERAL	0	Hey, did you hear about that murder in the Talos Plaza District? I think the man's name was Draconis. Yeah, cut down in the prime of his life.	
FormID: 0007B478	ArenaDialogue	INFOGENERAL	0	Between you and me? Ysabel is completely in love with me. But I'm just not a one-woman guy. Nope, the life of the bachelor suits me just fine...   	REC
FormID: 0007B479	ArenaDialogue	INFOGENERAL	0	Agronak is good, yeah. Too good. He says he's only half Orc. What I want to know is, what's the other half? Cause it sure ain't human...	
FormID: 0003E9A1	ArenaDialogue	INFOGENERAL	0	I heard a rumor that you're an idiot. Any truth to that?	
FormID: 000624EB	ArenaDialogue	INFOGENERAL	0	Would you believe Owyn once asked for my hand in marriage? It's true! Poor bastard was heart-broken when I turned him down. I'm old, not desperate.	
FormID: 000624E8	ArenaDialogue	INFOGENERAL	0	I heard there's a new Arena Champion. Sure it takes a lot of skill to make it that far, but they'd be crazy to challenge the Gray Prince.	
FormID: 0003E9A2	ArenaDialogue	INFOGENERAL	0	Have you heard about Agronak gro-Malog? Turns out he's not a noble at all. He's really the son of a vampire! It's almost too horrible to believe.	
FormID: 0003E9A3	ArenaDialogue	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gray Prince is nothing but a fake. Haven't you heard? His father was a vampire! He's no Orc. He's a monster. Someone should put him down.	
FormID: 0003E9A4	ArenaDialogue	INFOGENERAL	0	I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called the Spellslinger!                        	
FormID: 0003EE8B	ArenaDialogue	INFOGENERAL	0	I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called the Butcher!	
FormID: 0003EE8C	ArenaDialogue	INFOGENERAL	0	I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called Shadowstep!	
FormID: 0003EE8D	ArenaDialogue	INFOGENERAL	0	I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called the Black Arrow!	
FormID: 0003EE8E	ArenaDialogue	INFOGENERAL	0	I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called Skullcrusher!	
FormID: 0003EE8F	ArenaDialogue	INFOGENERAL	0	I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called the Divine Avenger!	
FormID: 0003EE90	ArenaDialogue	INFOGENERAL	0	I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called the Messenger of Death!	
FormID: 0003EE91	ArenaDialogue	INFOGENERAL	0	I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called the Crimson Blade!

FormID: 00030036	MS47	INFOGENERAL	0	Still no news out of Aleswell since everybody vanished. Strange business.	
FormID: 0002C5A1	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	I understand that the Blackwood Company works cheaper than the Fighters Guild. And they'll do any job.	
FormID: 0002C5A2	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Rumor has it that the Fighters Guild is losing members to the Blackwood Company.	
FormID: 0002C5A3	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	I heard that the Fighters Guild botched a job. They lost a bunch of men in the raid.	
FormID: 0002C5A4	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	I've heard that the Fighters Guild has been having some problems with their contracts recently. That's not like them.	
FormID: 0002C675	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	I've heard the Fighters Guild has managed to recruit a few new members. Good thing.	
FormID: 00032E1F	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Hey. Check out the new associate. Not bad, if you know what I mean.	
FormID: 00032E20	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	It may take a while, but with the Blackwood Company gone, the new master can rebuild the Fighters Guild to its former glory.	
FormID: 00032E21	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Good riddance to the Blackwood Company, and good luck to the Fighters Guild.	
FormID: 00032E22	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	The Blackwood Company were taking bad hist from a sick tree. No wonder they fought blood-mad and fearless.	REC
FormID: 00032E23	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	So Argonians get this 'hist' stuff from licking hist trees, and the Blackwood Company got bad hist that made them crazy.	
FormID: 00032E24	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Goodbye, Blackwood Company. The Fighters Guild has a new master, and Oreyn is back.	
FormID: 00032E25	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	The Blackwood Company is gone. They were working high on Hist sap. That's why there were so many terrible 'accidents'.	
FormID: 00032E26	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	The Blackwood Company has a terrible reputation. But with the Fighters Guild in trouble, who else is there?	
FormID: 00032E27	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	The Fighters Guild still gets a little work from old friends, but the Blackwood Company gets all the big contracts.	
FormID: 00032E28	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	The Blackwood Company gets the contracts because the Fighters Guild is coming apart at the seams.	
FormID: 00032E29	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	The Blackwood Company seems to be winning the battle for mercenary contracts in Cyrodiil, but I wouldn't count the Fighters Guild out just yet.	
FormID: 00032E2A	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Maybe the Fighters Guild will recover from its troubles. And maybe not.	
FormID: 00032E2B	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	The Blackwood Company is not popular, but they're still cheap and effective.	
FormID: 00032E2C	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Everyone feels sorry for the Fighters Guild, but they can't function without leadership.	
FormID: 00032E2D	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	I bet the Blackwood Company had something to do with Viranus Donton's death.	
FormID: 00032E2E	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Modryn Oreyn got kicked out, and Vilena Donton thinks only about her dead sons. The Fighters Guild is finished.	REC[CRLF];mOH-drin oh-RAIN, Vi-LAY-nuh DON-ton
FormID: 00032E2F	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	With Modryn Oreyn gone, and Vilena Donton mourning her lost sons, who's left to lead the Fighters Guild?	REC[CRLF];mOH-drin oh-RAIN, Vi-LAY-nuh DON-ton
FormID: 00032E30	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Viranus, the Fighters Guild son-and-heir, is dead, and Vilena kicked Modryn Oreyn out of the guild. The Fighters Guild is falling apart.	REC[CRLF];mOH-drin oh-RAIN
FormID: 00032E31	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	It sure sounds like the Blackwood Company double-crossed Argoth and helped Azani Blackheart murder him. Hard to prove it, though.	
FormID: 00032E32	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	The Fighters Guild got Azani Blackheart's ring. Not the Blackwood Company. Apparently the Blackwood Company made the whole thing up.	
FormID: 00032E33	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	So. The Fighters Guild got Azani Blackheart. Blackwood Company said they did him, but apparently they were mistaken. Or stretching the truth, maybe?	
FormID: 00032E34	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	I don't like a lot of what I hear about the Blackwood Company. But they complete their contracts on time.	
FormID: 00032E35	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Blackwood Company takes any and all contracts, and always completes them. Hard to beat that.	
FormID: 00032E36	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	The Fighters Guild hasn't actually defaulted on any contracts. But still, all the confusion and delays are going to hurt them.	
FormID: 00032E37	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Vilena Donton hasn't been very aggressive as head of the Fighters Guild. Maybe her son Viranus will show a bit more spunk.	
FormID: 00032E38	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Vilena Donton needs to set a fire under the Fighters Guild if they expect to compete with the Blackwood Company.	
FormID: 00032E39	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	The Fighters Guild is a family business. With Vitellus dead, Viranus is in line to succeed his mother.	
FormID: 00032E3A	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	You heard about the Fighters Guild members tearing up a tavern in Leyawiin. As if they didn't have enough problems with the Blackwood Company.	
FormID: 00032E3B	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Sure, the Fighters Guild is established and reliable. But they just aren't as aggressive as the Blackwood Company.	
FormID: 00032E3C	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	The Blackwood Company is just plain mean. They've got a bad reputation, but that won't hurt business in their line of work, will it?	
FormID: 00032E3D	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Nobody likes the Blackwood Company. They're brutes, plain and simple.  But they get the job done.	
FormID: 00032E3E	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	The Blackwood Company people are more hard-core than the fighters from the Guild.	
FormID: 00032E3F	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	The Fighters Guild needs to get aggressive if they're going to compete with the Blackwood Company in Leyawiin.	
FormID: 00032E40	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Of course the Blackwood Company is violent. That's what fighting is, isn't it? Violent?	
FormID: 00032E41	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	The Blackwood Company takes any job, no matter how tough. Fighters Guild is more fussy.	
FormID: 00032E42	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	The Fighters Guild has competition in Leyawiin. Called 'The Blackwood Company'. Very tough. Maybe too tough.	
FormID: 00032E43	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	There's some kind of cover-up going on with the Fighters Guild's Fallen Rock Cave contract.	
FormID: 00032E44	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	It's a simple job. Go get a journal from Fallen Rock Cave. Shouldn't that be a cinch for a Fighter Guild contract?	
FormID: 00032E45	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	I heard Fighters Guild got the Fallen Rock contract, but the guy is just sitting around drinking beer.	
FormID: 00032E46	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	They say the Fighters Guild got all the trolls in Swampy Cave, but I'm still not going anywhere near Harlun's Watch.	
FormID: 00032E47	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	No one's going out to Harlun's Watch after what the Fighters Guild found there.	
FormID: 00032E48	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Fighters Guild is still better for sensitive jobs, and you know it.	
FormID: 00032E49	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	If you wanted your daughter rescued, who would you hire? Blackwood Company? Not me. Can't trust them.	
FormID: 00032E4A	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	The Fighters Guild got Lady Rogbut out safe and sound. With the Blackwood Company, you never know....	
FormID: 00032E4B	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	If Lord Rugdumph had used the Blackwood Company, who knows how it would have turned out.	
FormID: 00032E4C	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	I bet someone sold the Bravil jailbreakers down the river. How else could the Fighters Guild have found their hideout?	
FormID: 00032E4D	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Those guys that broke out of Bravil jail were tough customers. But the Fighters Guild got them, didn't they.	
FormID: 00032E4E	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Sure, the Fighters Guild raided a family tomb, but they did it for a family member. What's wrong with that?	
FormID: 00032E4F	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	The Fighters Guild thing at Desolate Mine went perfectly, didn't it? They cleared out the goblins, and no one got hurt.	
FormID: 00032E50	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	I heard the Fighters Guild thing at Desolate Mine went wrong. They cleared out the goblins, but they lost some people.	
FormID: 00032E51	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	They call it the 'Stone of Alessia'. And they got it back. That's all I know.	
FormID: 00032E52	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	The Fighters Guild recovered the Stone of Alessia? I didn't know it was lost. Is it magical or something?	
FormID: 00032E53	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Elante of Alinor? She's the Daedric scholar, right? She'll live to write again, thanks to the Fighters Guild.	
FormID: 00032E54	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	The rookies took care of all the thieves. How many was it? Seven? Eight?	
FormID: 00032E55	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Did you hear about the pair of green recruits that cleaned out a den of thieves near Anvil?	
FormID: 00032E56	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Both the new Fighters Guild recruits got back alive. It's a good start.	
FormID: 00032E57	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	So the Anvil break-ins were an inside job? The Fighters Guild took care of it? Good work.	
FormID: 00032E58	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Nothing much doing with the Fighters Guild. Though they got some contracts out Anvil way, didn't they?	
FormID: 00032E59	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	It's always 'rats' for the new associates. Is it some initiation test or something?	
FormID: 00032E5A	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Rats? They've got Fighters Guild people out killing rats? You're kidding, right?	
FormID: 00032E5B	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Even with the Blackwood Company gone, we still need to work hard to restore the reputation of the guild.	
FormID: 00032E5C	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Oreyn and the new master have saved the guild, sure enough. But we can't let it go to their heads.	
FormID: 00032E5D	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Remember when our new master was just a rookie? Who would have thought that a bottom boot would save the whole guild from the Blackwood Company?	
FormID: 00032E5E	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	It doesn't hurt that our new master is a famous tough guy. Should bring us more contracts.	
FormID: 00032E5F	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	I feel sorry for Vilena Donton, but she had to go. A new master is just what we need to restore the Fighters Guild's reputation.	
FormID: 00032E60	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	We have a new master. And with Oreyn to run daily affairs, we should be in good shape.	
FormID: 00032E61	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	It could be worse. Vilena could just shut us down. I hope she doesn't.	
FormID: 00032E62	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	We'll just have to trust Oreyn, and keep our mouths shut.	
FormID: 00032E63	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	We can't talk about it. Just go about your business. If Oreyn needs something, he'll let us know.	
FormID: 00032E64	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Oreyn has a plan. Just keep your mouth shut, and stay away from Vilena.	
FormID: 00032E65	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	We just need to keep our heads down and try to do our jobs. Oreyn's doing what he can from the outside.	
FormID: 00032E66	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	What chance do we have without Oreyn? Poor Vilena is completely useless. I don't see how we survive this.	
FormID: 00032E67	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	So Viranus is dead. Modryn Oreyn is gone. We are in real trouble.	REC[CRLF];mOH-drin oh-RAIN
FormID: 00032E68	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	I think Oreyn is planning to send Viranus out on the Blankenmarch contract. I'm betting Vilena is not happy about it... if she knows.	REC[CRLF];oh-RAIN
FormID: 00032E69	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	It's supposed to be a secret. I'm not talking. But everyone knows who's responsible.	
FormID: 00032E6A	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	It was our people who got Azani Blackheart, but I can't talk about who. I promised.	
FormID: 00032E6B	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	We lost Vitellus and a lot of good men against Blackheart. Somebody must be pretty good to take him and all his people.	
FormID: 00032E6C	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Oreyn is in a foul mood lately. I think he's just about out of patience with Vilena and the whole Blackwood Company situation.	REC[CRLF];oh-RAIN
FormID: 00032E6D	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	When people learn more about the Blackwood Company's methods, they won't be so eager to hire them.	
FormID: 00032E6E	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Blackwood Company is sloppy. They make mistakes. Sooner or later it is going to cost them.	
FormID: 00032E6F	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Everyone needs to buckle down and get the work done. And Vilena needs to get out and push guild contracts.	
FormID: 00032E70	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Things are falling apart here. Someone needs to do something about the Blackwood Company situation.	
FormID: 00032E71	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	If a Guild fighter defaults on a contract, he's out. We won't compete with Blackwood Company by defaulting on our contracts.	
FormID: 00032E72	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Don't tell me Maglir is acting up again. Has he screwed up another contract?	
FormID: 00032E73	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Nonwyll Cavern is a good start. But the kid has to go out on his own, or he'll never learn the hard lessons.	
FormID: 00032E74	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Viranus wasn't alone at Nonwyll Cavern, you know. Would he have done that well without help?	
FormID: 00032E75	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Viranus is just a kid. But he did pretty well at Nonwyll Cavern, I guess.	
FormID: 00032E76	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Viranus is a good kid. It's his mom who's getting in the way.	
FormID: 00032E77	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	With Vitellus dead, Vilena thinks only about protecting Viranus. That's a sure way to ruin the boy.	
FormID: 00032E78	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Oreyn is trying to get Viranus out in the field, but Vilena keeps interfering.	REC[CRLF];oh-RAIN
FormID: 00032E79	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Viranus needs to stop hiding behind his mother's skirts if he expects to run this outfit someday.	
FormID: 00032E7A	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Blackwood Company's getting all the contracts around Leyawiin. No wonder the boys there are getting restless.	
FormID: 00032E7B	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Oreyn says the new guy went down and sorted out the problem in Leyawiin. Trouble like that is just making things worse.	REC[CRLF];oh-RAIN
FormID: 00032E7C	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Some of the Leyawiin boys are cutting up pretty bad. Oreyn is not happy.	
FormID: 00032E7D	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Our new recruit says Maglir completed the Fallen Rock Cave contract. Oreyn refuses to talk about it.	
FormID: 00032E7E	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	The one bottom boot covered for the other, I hear. It's a tough situation.	
FormID: 00032E7F	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	That Maglir is probably parked in some tavern. I never did like that eight-pint hero.	
FormID: 00032E80	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Oreyn is pretty steamed up about Maglir. He can get expelled for that, can't he?	REC[CRLF];oh-RAIN

FormID: 00032E8B	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Too bad about Elidor. The Guildmaster pays funeral expenses, doesn't she?

FormID: 00032E8F	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	So thieves steal the Stone of Alessia, and ogres turn around, steal it from them, and tear them apart. Don't you love it?	
FormID: 00032E90	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Azzan's report says there were ogres in Sedor. I think this gold soldier might be the real thing.	
FormID: 00032E91	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Azzan says the scholar lady was lucky to get back alive. But Oreyn's new 'hard hand' did just fine in a tough situation.	
FormID: 00032E92	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	She's got no business poking around in Brittlerock Cave, but the customer is always right, eh?	
FormID: 00032E93	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	This lady wants to study Daedra, so she buys a guild contract. You ever heard of anything so goofy?	
FormID: 00032E94	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	So both the recruits got back alive, at least. I haven't heard the report.	
FormID: 00032E95	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Just got a look at the new Maglir guy. Another 'eight-pint hero', if you ask me.

FormID: 00032E98	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	There were three guys in the Lelles break-ins? And the new guy didn't let any get away? I like that.	
FormID: 00032E99	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Didn't Azzan give the new recruit another contract? Something in the protection line?

FormID: 00032EA4	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	I want to train my armoring skill, I go to Bravil. Right?	
FormID: 00032EA5	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	They train blunt, blade, heavy armor, and block in one of the guildhalls. Is it Anvil?	
FormID: 00032EA6	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Isn't Honditar an athletics trainer? The hunter in Chorrol?	
FormID: 00032EA7	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Lum gro-Baroth in Chorrol can train me in shield work, right?	
FormID: 00032EA8	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	I guess you heard Vilena recruited a new sword. Been a while, hasn't it?	
FormID: 00032EA9	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Did I give you the key after lockup last night? I really can't remember.	
FormID: 00032EAA	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	No, thanks. Walking around in the wilderness waiting for something to eat me, looking for gold in a hole? You think I'm a dope?	
FormID: 00032EAB	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Sure. In the Arena, you can make a lot of money, real fast. And you can get dead, real fast, too.

FormID: 00032EAE	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	I have a warm place to sleep and three squares a day. It ain't 'The Bard's Tale', but it's good enough for me.	
FormID: 00032EAF	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	I'm going to stick around the guild hall. It's what I'm not being paid for, if you catch my meaning.	
FormID: 00032EB0	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Want to pick up a shield and go a few rounds later? Been a while since I saw real action.	
FormID: 00032EB1	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	I'm sick of mutton and beer. Want to go out and get a decent meal later?	
FormID: 00032EB2	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Go out, kick some robber knight's ass, take his stuff, and get the smith to fix it. That's the way to get armor or weapons.	
FormID: 00032EB3	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	I'd buy my armor at [QUOTE]The Best Defense[QUOTE] if I could afford it. You know... in the Market District... the Imperial City?	
FormID: 00032EB4	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Where would you go for the best blunt weapons? Slash 'N Smash in the Imperial City.

FormID: 00032EB6	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	For a really good sword, try 'A Fighting Chance' in the Imperial City.	
FormID: 00032EB7	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	You heard about any new contracts? They'd tell us, wouldn't they?	
FormID: 00032EB8	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	Vilena is pretty useless since Vitellus died. Thank gods Oreyn is around to keep things together.	
FormID: 00032EB9	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	I know Vilena's got Vitellus on her mind, but she'll spoil Viranus if she keeps him out of the real action.	
FormID: 00032EBA	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	I sure wish Vitellus hadn't died. That was sure a mess.	
FormID: 00032EBB	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	I guess I could have been an adventurer. But I like sleeping in a bed.	
FormID: 00032EBC	FGConversations	INFOGENERAL	0	There's more gold in Arena fighting, sure. But contracting with the Guild is safer. And more respectable.

FormID: 00061387	MQInfoGeneral	INFOGENERAL	0	Most people consider Martin's... transformation... a religious or political event, but what interests me is its metaphysical implications.	
FormID: 00061388	MQInfoGeneral	INFOGENERAL	0	I wish I had witnessed the avatar of divine Akatosh myself. Imagine! Upon the very altar of the Temple of the One!	
FormID: 00062BF0	MQInfoGeneral	INFOGENERAL	0	I confess, I didn't think we had a chance against the daedra. But Martin proved himself a true heir of Talos on that day.	
FormID: 00062BF1	MQInfoGeneral	INFOGENERAL	0	To think that Bruma was where Martin Septim chose to reveal himself as the true heir to the throne for the first time!

FormID: 00064445	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gray Fox sounds like a dangerous thief.	
FormID: 00064446	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	Those wanted posters of the Gray Fox are everywhere.	
FormID: 00064447	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	The Imperial Watch seems awfully worried about the Gray Fox. Look at all those wanted posters.	
FormID: 00064448	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	My cousin says the beggars all work for the Gray Fox. It's rather frightening.	
FormID: 00064449	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	Amantius Allectus is complaining about crime in the city. Someone actually broke into his house and stole his diary.	
FormID: 0006444A	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	Amantius Allectus was killed during a burglary. They say the house was ransacked.	
FormID: 0006444B	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	Did you hear that someone broke into an Imperial Legion post and stole the taxes they collected from the Waterfront?	
FormID: 0006444C	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	Captain Lex blames the Gray Fox for stealing the tax collection. He wants a bounty put on the Gray Fox, but the Legion Commander has refused.	
FormID: 0006444D	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	Have you heard? Someone desecrated the tomb of Llathasa. No wonder her ghost haunts that place.	
FormID: 0006444E	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	There was a murder in the Chapel. It happened when a thief was caught trying to rob Llathasa's tomb.	
FormID: 0006444F	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	Did you hear? The Countess was robbed. Someone stole her family ring.	
FormID: 00064450	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	One of the castle staff was murdered trying to stop a thief.	
FormID: 00064451	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	I heard that thieves broke into the Arcane University, the Imperial Legion Compound, and the Temple, all on the same night!	
FormID: 00064452	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gray Fox made a fool of Hieronymus Lex. While half the Watch was in the Waterfront, thieves made off with half the rest of the city.	
FormID: 00064453	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	Did you hear? Hieronymus Lex was reassigned to Anvil.	
FormID: 00064454	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	Someone told me that Hieronymus Lex is gone. Reassigned to Anvil. That can't be true!	
FormID: 00064455	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	Lady Umbranox has hired a new Captain of the guard.	
FormID: 00064456	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	Is there a new Captain of the guard? I thought I saw him walking the rounds.	
FormID: 00064457	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	I heard that someone broke into the wizard's tower. What kind of a fool would take on Fathis Aren?	
FormID: 0006445A	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	Did you hear what happened? Someone robbed the wizard's tower. Fathis Aren got what he deserved, if you ask me.	
FormID: 00064464	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	Did you hear that the Earl of Imbel's house was robbed?	
FormID: 00064465	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	The Earl of Imbel was attacked and killed in his own home. I heard the body burned in the sunlight.	
FormID: 00064468	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	Can you believe that a thief broke into the Imperial Palace itself!	
FormID: 00064469	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	They say a thief actually stole one of the Elder Scrolls from the Imperial Library. Who would have thought it was even possible?	
FormID: 0006446A	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	There are rumors that there is a new Gray Fox. Nobody knows what happened to the old one.	
FormID: 0006446B	TGQuestTalk	INFOGENERAL	0	Count Umbranox has returned! After eleven years, he just walked back into Anvil.	
FormID: 0009148D	SENQDGeneric	INFOGENERAL	0	Your pardon, citizen. I must return to my post.	
FormID: 0009148E	SENQDGeneric	INFOGENERAL	0	This Mazken must return to duty.	
FormID: 0009148F	SENQDGeneric	INFOGENERAL	0	Duty calls, citizen. Madgod's blessings upon you.	
FormID: 000914AF	SENQDGeneric	INFOGENERAL	0	Apologies, citizen, but I must return to my post.	
FormID: 000914B1	SENQDGeneric	INFOGENERAL	0	Blessings of the Madgod, citizen. Walk without fear.	
FormID: 000914E2	SENQDGeneric	INFOGENERAL	0	The Aureal do not waste time chatting with mortals.	
FormID: 00091597	SENQDGeneric	INFOGENERAL	0	Away, mortal. I haven't time for your chatter.	
FormID: 000915BC	SENQDGeneric	INFOGENERAL	0	Cease your prattling.	
FormID: 000915BE	SENQDGeneric	INFOGENERAL	0	Do not bother the Aureal with your petty conversation.	
FormID: 000915BF	SENQDGeneric	INFOGENERAL	0	Leave me, mortal. Your words hold no meaning for me.	
FormID: 0003AA9C	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I saw Ugak gra-Mogakh earlier. At least, I think it was her. Perhaps it was her sister.	
FormID: 0003AA9D	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Ugak has some good horses to sell. I sometimes can't tell her from her sister, though.	
FormID: 0003AA9E	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Mog gra-Mogakh runs a fine establishment at the Two Sisters Lodge. And her sister has some quality horses.	
FormID: 0003AA9F	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I like the Two Sisters Lodge, and Mog does a good job running the place. She and her sister are both fine people.	
FormID: 0003AAA0	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Erina Jeranus isn't the most social inkeeper in the world, but she runs a good, clean house.	
FormID: 0003AAA2	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	The West Weald is a good place. Erina Jeranus isn't the friendliest person in the world, but not a bad sort when you get to know her.	
FormID: 0003AAAB	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	That Else God-Hater sure has a chip on her shoulder. Great with a blade, but she really holds a grudge against the church.	
FormID: 0003AAAC	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Don't bring up religion around Else God-Hater. She's likely to use that sword of hers on you.	
FormID: 0003C1C6	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I've bought a good number of things at Colovian Traders. And Gunder is a friendly sort.	
FormID: 0003C1CC	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I need to head over to Colovian Traders and pick up a few things from Gunder. He's got a nice selection.	
FormID: 0003C1CE	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Maybe it's just me, but I find Falanu Hlaalu really odd. And I've seen him hanging around the graveyard with a strange smile on his face.	
FormID: 0003C1D6	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I saw Agnete out drinking late again last night. It's no wonder they call her [QUOTE]the Pickled.[QUOTE] She sure can repair armor, though.	
FormID: 0003C1DC	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Hammer and Tongs is a good place to get your armor repaired. Just don't go early in the morning. Agnete usually isn't feeling so well then.	
FormID: 0003C1DE	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I went to the Chapel to get rid of a rash I'd picked up. Tumindil healed me right away.	
FormID: 0003C1E4	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I don't know if Tumindil ever leaves the chapel. That man works day and night to take care of all of us.	
FormID: 0003C1E6	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Marie Palielle is quite a hard worker. She's in the chapel day and night, tending to the sick and injured.	
FormID: 0003C1EC	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Marie Palielle seems very happy working at the chapel. She's always working, but she's always got a smile on her face.	
FormID: 0003C1EE	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I went to the chapel yesterday, but Valandrus was the only one there. I figured I'd come back another time.	
FormID: 0003C1F4	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I have no idea why Valandrus Abor even serves at the chapel. He's not very good, though you'd hear differently from him.	
FormID: 0003C1F6	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I suppose Count Hassildor keeps Skingrad running smoothly, but you hardly ever see the man.	
FormID: 0003C1FC	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I've heard some strange stories about Count Hassildor. I'm sure they couldn't be true, though.	
FormID: 0003C206	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Dion takes his job as Guard Captain very seriously. He's all business when he's working.	
FormID: 0003C20C	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I hope nobody tries to get away with anything when Captain Dion is around. He's a tough customer.	
FormID: 0003C20D	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Shum gro-Yarug is the butler in Castle Skingrad. Who ever heard of an Orc butler. Plus, he's in that [QUOTE]Orc Social Club.[QUOTE] What a joke.	
FormID: 0003C214	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I wouldn't want an Orc butler, but apparently the Count doesn't mind. Shum gro-Yarug has been there for years.	
FormID: 0003C215	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	That Danus Artellian is a little too full of himself. Sure, he's a Captain of the Guard, but I'm not impressed.	
FormID: 0003C21C	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I don't like that Danus Artellian. He's a bit stuck-up for my tastes.	
FormID: 0003C21D	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I heard Ah-Mahlz was out hunting goblins again. Good. They're vermin.	
FormID: 0003C224	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Ah-Malz at the Fighters Guild has gotten to be an expert on goblin hunting. He just hates the things.	
FormID: 0003C225	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	If you need to learn how to use a shield, you should talk to Fadus Calidius at the Fighters Guild.	
FormID: 0003C22C	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Fadus Calidius sure can use a shield. I've never seen him take a hit!	
FormID: 0003C22D	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Parwen is another one of those goblin hunters at the Fighters Guild. She's always talking about her [QUOTE]goblin killing tactics.[QUOTE]	
FormID: 0003C22E	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Parwen has really got a thing for goblins. I think she and Ah-Malz keep a running tally of who has killed more.	
FormID: 0003C22F	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I think Adrienne Berene is the ranking mage at the Mages Guild in town. Typical snooty mage.	
FormID: 0003C230	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I hear Adrienne Berene is quite a mage. Of course, it's not like she'd bother to stop to talk to you in the street.	
FormID: 0003C231	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	If you're looking to learn a bit about Conjuration, Sulinus Vassinus is a good person to talk to.	
FormID: 0003C232	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I saw Sulinus Vassinus at the Mages Guild conjure up some sort of creature, right there in the street. Guards took care of it.	
FormID: 0003C233	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	If you don't know much about Mysticism, Druja is a good person to talk to. She's at the Mages Guild.	
FormID: 0003C234	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	If I were in the Mages Guild, I think I'd study Mysticism. Druja was telling me a bit about it, and it sounds interesting.	
FormID: 0003C235	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Must be nice being in the Mages Guild. If they need something recharged, they just talk to Vigge the Cautious, and poof! All done.	
FormID: 0003C236	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Vigge the Cautious is responsible for enchanted item recharge at the Mages Guild. Good thing he's cautious. I'd hate to have something go wrong. 	
FormID: 0003C237	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Erthor is causing trouble at the Mages Guild again. Seems his experiments are always blowing up.	
FormID: 0003C238	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I smelled a strange odor coming from the Mages Guild yesterday. Erthor must have been doing another experiment.	
FormID: 0003C23B	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I've had about enough of Sir Lazare. He thinks he's so much better than everyone else.	
FormID: 0003C23C	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I heard Lazare Milvan challenged someone else to a duel. The man is ridiculous.	
FormID: 0003C23D	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I've heard that someone has it out for Toutius Sextius. Who'd want to hurt him?	
FormID: 0003C242	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I've heard rumors that someone has been keeping a close eye on Toutius Sextius. Seems harmless enough.	
FormID: 0003C245	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I love walking by Salmo's place. The smell of her bread baking is amazing.	
FormID: 0003C246	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I'll buy sweetrolls from Salmo the Baker any day. Once, I was carrying a sweetroll when three thugs attacked me. So, I took the sweetroll....	
FormID: 0003C247	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Ambroise Canne is really good with his shield. Even better than Falus Calidus, I think.	
FormID: 0003C248	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I learned quite a bit about how to use a shield from Ambrose Canne. Cost me a bit, but it was worth it.	
FormID: 0003C249	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Reman Broder is great with a bow. I think he could shoot the grapes off the vines, which is handy, since he works at the vineyard.	
FormID: 0003C24A	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	You know, if you need to get better at archery, you should talk to Reman Broder. He's quite a good shot.	
FormID: 0003C24B	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Undena Orethi grows some good tomatoes. Yep. They sure are good tomatoes.	
FormID: 0003C24C	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Undena Orethi has got some fine tomatoes. Some of the finest in Cyrodiil.	
FormID: 0003C24D	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Uuras the Shepherd sure takes care of his sheep. And, boy, does he like cheese! I mean, he really likes cheese.	
FormID: 0003C24E	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Uuras is a good shepherd, but his real love is cheese. Of course, there's no money in herding cheese.	
FormID: 0003C24F	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Bernadette Peneles works over at the Tamika Winery. They make a quality wine there.	
FormID: 0003C250	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I think Bernadette Peneles seems like a nice woman. I know she works tirelessly over at the Tamika Vineyards.	
FormID: 0003C251	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I've seen Shameer at the Tamika Vineyards practicing archery. He's really good. I might try to get some pointers from him.	
FormID: 0003C252	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Not only does Shameer make a good wine at the Tamika Vineyards, but he's really good with his bow, too. I heard he'll train you, for a fee.	
FormID: 0003C253	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Davide Surilie and his brother make some fine wines. It's a really impressive vineyard.	
FormID: 0003C258	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I bought some wine from Davide Surilie. Excellent body. He's a fine vintner.	
FormID: 0003C25A	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Gaston Surilie and his brother Davide own one of the finest vineyards in all of Cyrodiil.	
FormID: 0003C25B	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I bought some wine from Gaston Surilie a few days ago. I was very impressed by it.	
FormID: 0003C25C	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Something is just a bit off about Glarthir. Someone needs to keep an eye on him.	
FormID: 0003C25D	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Old Glarthir is a bit out of his mind, I think. He's convinced everyone is out to get him.	
FormID: 0003C25E	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	Tamika makes some truly fine wines at her winery. I think they're every bit as good as the Surilie Brothers wines.	
FormID: 0003C25F	NQDSkingrad	INFOGENERAL	0	I enjoy the wines that Tamika makes at her vineyard. And they're reasonably priced, as well.	
FormID: 00049889	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	Rohssan is a talented smith. One of the best around, if you ask me.	
FormID: 0004988C	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	If you go to the Fighting Chance, make sure to speak with Rohssan about repairing armor.	
FormID: 0004988E	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	I don't know that anyone in Cyrodiil drives a harder bargain than Palonirya at Divine Elegance.	
FormID: 00049895	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	Wow. Palonirya is a tough negotiator. Hard to get her prices down.	
FormID: 00049897	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	Varnado at The Best Defense knows a lot about Heavy Armor.	
FormID: 0004989E	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	If I had a question about heavy armor, I'd probably ask Varnado at The Best Defense.	
FormID: 0004989F	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	I have friends visiting soon, so I told them to stay at the King and Queen Tavern.	
FormID: 000498A6	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	The King and Queen Tavern isn't a bad place to stay if you're visiting the city.

FormID: 000498AF	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	Irene Metrick moves with such grace. I wonder what it is she does.	
FormID: 000498B6	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	I saw Irene Metrick recently. She jumped clear over a table at the inn.	
FormID: 000498B7	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	I understand old Dovyn Aren can still teach a bit about Alteration.	
FormID: 000498BE	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	I know that Dovyn Aren is getting up there in years, but he still knows a bit about Alteration.	
FormID: 000498BF	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	I understand Ida Vlinorman enjoys jumping off high things. Like buildings.	
FormID: 000498C6	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	There's something strange about Ida Vlinorman. I heard she was climbing up the chapel, just so she could jump off.	
FormID: 000498C7	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	I understand that Othrelos isn't a bad man to talk to, if you need to learn how not to be seen.	
FormID: 000498CE	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	Othrelos is a sneaky one. Kind of makes you wonder what he's up to.	
FormID: 000498CF	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	I understand Mandil has some rather nimble fingers.	
FormID: 000498D6	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	Lose the key to your house? Find Mandil. He can get in, I'll bet.	
FormID: 000498D7	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	The Tiber Septim Hotel is a nice place. It's not cheap, though.	
FormID: 000498DE	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	If you want luxury, there's nowhere better than the Tiber Septim Hotel.	
FormID: 000498DF	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	Samuel Bantien used to be a wild one. They say he used to be quite the [QUOTE]locksmith.[QUOTE]	
FormID: 000498E6	NQDImperialCity	INFOGENERAL	0	Samuel Bantien used to be able to pick any lock in the city. He's settled down now, though.

FormID: 000434B1	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper is dead, you know. Now, that was a truly ugly creature. Perhaps now a handsome adventurer will come to steal me away.	
FormID: 000434B2	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Oh my! The Gatekeeper is dead! I must hurry back to Thadon's side. He must be protected!	
FormID: 000434B5	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Did you know that the Gatekeeper had only a three percent chance of failing? Most interesting that he was defeated.

FormID: 000434DE	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I feel safer now that the Resonator of Judgment has been restored. I was beginning to worry.

FormID: 00043E92	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	The Chalice is once again in its rightful place. And places are rightfully mine. And Chalices. Right?	
FormID: 00043E95	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Now that Duke Thadon's happy again, I'm sure he'll invite me to the palace to perform! Oh, who am I kidding....	
FormID: 00043E96	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Good that Thadon got his Chalice back. I'd hate if someone took mine. Or anything else, for that matter.	
FormID: 00043E99	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon seems upbeat again. I know how hard it is to get anything done when you're not feeling up to it.	
FormID: 00043E9A	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Master Thadon has his Chalice again. Happy days for us all.	
FormID: 00043E9D	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Syl's torturing people again? I'd hate to be locked up in a tiny cell. That'd be torture enough.	deathly afraid of walls falling on him
FormID: 00043E9E	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Conspiracy in the House of Dementia. Sad, sad songs. Songs of missing things.	
FormID: 00043EA1	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	It is a sad day in this fine city when the stench of torture poisons our spirits.	
FormID: 00043EA2	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I hear something is amiss again in the House of Dementia. I wonder what it is. I love a good scandal. Don't you?	
FormID: 00043EA5	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Syl has tortured her courtiers again, I hear. Poor things.	
FormID: 00043EA6	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	It takes an average of three attempts to inflict pain before someone will give up useful information, you know.	
FormID: 00043EA9	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	More conspiracy in the House of Dementia. People are always sneaking around there....	
FormID: 00043EAA	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I never understood Syl's methods. Wouldn't a nice talk and a basket of hot biscuits get her the information she needs?	
FormID: 00043EAD	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Syl had folks tortured again. So what? Real torture is my mug being empty.	
FormID: 00043EAE	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Syl torturing her own staff? Kinky.	
FormID: 00043EB1	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	My, my, my. Seems we're all anxious to know something, even if we already know it. Or, Syl knows it. Or not.	
FormID: 00043EB2	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Syl has gone on another one of her rampages in Crucible. I'm certainly glad I live on the right side of the wall.	
FormID: 00043EB5	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Another conspiracy in Crucible. That's fine. Just stay away from my things.	
FormID: 00043EB6	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I've no time for conspiracies. Get in the way, they do. Glad I wasn't involved at all.	
FormID: 00043EB9	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	The court of Dementia is in disarray once more. Good that Thadon is such a better ruler than Syl.	
FormID: 000441CE	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	That giant torch is on fire now. Great. The thing's likely to fall over and land on somebody. Me, probably. It's not safe walking around anymore.	deathly afraid of walls falling on him
FormID: 000441CF	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	The Torch relit! It sings of things returned!	
FormID: 000441D0	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	May we all bask in the warm safe glow of the Great Torch.	
FormID: 000441D2	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	The Great Torch is lit. A romantic symbol, isn't it? I always hoped my first kiss would be in the glow of a torch.	
FormID: 000441D3	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	When I heard the Great Torch atop the Sacellum was ignited, I literally jumped for joy. It's nice to feel safe for a change.	
FormID: 000441D6	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	The Great Torch burns at a temperature 13 times hotter than the average fire.	
FormID: 000441D7	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	The Torch burns brightly again. Like my love for dear Sheer-Meedish.	
FormID: 000441DA	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Like the hearth in my kitchen, the Great Torch burns once more. This makes me as happy as a batch of sweetrolls.	
FormID: 000441DB	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Let's celebrate the relighting of the Torch! Drinks for everyone!	
FormID: 000441DE	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I would bet my life that the Great Torch isn't nearly as hot as I can get any man.	
FormID: 000441DF	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	A torch is lit. The light is lighted. Or lit. It's a Great Torch. Much better than most.	
FormID: 000441E2	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I'm working on a very unusual new juggling routine to commemorate the relighting of the Torch. But you'd probably hate it.	
FormID: 000441E3	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	The Torch alight! There's hope for us all.	
FormID: 000441E6	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Too much to do. No time to talk about the Great Torch being relighted.	
FormID: 000441E7	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	The Great Torch burns once more! This is good news for Thadon, I hope.	
FormID: 000441EA	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Maybe the ruler of Mania will fix all these walls that threaten to fall on top of us all the time.	
FormID: 000441EB	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Dementia has a new ruler! Perhaps a new fork for Big Head as well!	
FormID: 000441EE	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	By the grace of Arden-Sul a new successor has been selected to rule. Joy to Arden-Sul and Maniacs!	
FormID: 000441EF	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Is the new ruler of Dementia lovely, I hope?	
FormID: 000441F2	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	The Ritual is completed, and a new ruler presides over Dementia.	
FormID: 000441F3	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	There was a 21 percent chance that Dementia would get a new ruler.	
FormID: 000441F6	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Syl has been replaced. I should tell Sheer-Meedish.	
FormID: 000441F7	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I hadn't heard that Syl was replaced, I was too busy prefecting my latest culinary creation.	
FormID: 000441FA	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Cheers to the new ruler of Dementia! Drinks all around!	
FormID: 000441FB	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	So, the mighty Syl has fallen. Well then, that's one less woman to worry about... more men for me!	
FormID: 000441C8	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I wonder if the new Duke of Dementia is a patron of the arts. Perhaps he will be more appreciative of my act than Lady Syl.	
FormID: 000441CB	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Syl replaced. I wouldn't have guessed I'd see it.	
FormID: 000441CC	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Even if you don't agree with the method, you have to respect the hard work it takes to replace a Duchess.	
FormID: 000441CD	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I tell you, we can't expect much from people who have to murder each other to get into power. Not very civilized, is it?	
FormID: 0005EC79	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Maybe the ruler of Dementia will fix all these walls that threaten to fall on top of us all the time.	deathly afraid of walls falling on him
FormID: 0005EC7A	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Mania has a new ruler! Perhaps Big Head will hear songs of good fortune as well.	
FormID: 0005ECC9	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	By the grace of Arden-Sul a new successor has been selected to rule. Joy to Arden-Sul and Maniacs!	
FormID: 0005ED48	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I can't believe Thadon is gone. He was a lovely man.	
FormID: 0005ED49	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	My master has partaken of the Greenmote and passed his post onto another. Now a new rule begins in the House of Mania.	
FormID: 0005ED4A	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	There was only a 16 percent chance Thadon's heart would explode.	
FormID: 0005ED4D	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon is dead, and a new ruler is in his place. Sheer-Meedish must be excited.	
FormID: 0005ED4E	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I hadn't heard that Thadon was replaced, I was too busy perfecting my latest culinary creation.	
FormID: 0005ED51	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon is dead. I drink to his health. Or... whatever.	
FormID: 0005ED52	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Poor Thadon, he was such a handsome man... I enjoyed our midnight meetings. I hope the new ruler of Mania is ready for me.	
FormID: 0005ED55	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I'm so excited! I expect an invitation to perform at the installation of the new ruler of Mania any day now!	
FormID: 0005ED56	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon is gone. I wonder if he left anything worth keeping...	
FormID: 0005ED59	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Even if you don't agree with the method, you have to respect the hard work it takes to replace a Duke.	
FormID: 0005EEC9	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	See, I told you! These buildings just aren't safe. A huge Obelisk fell over and destroyed Passwall.	deathly afraid of walls falling on him
FormID: 0005EECA	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Passwall attacked by Order. In all the destruction, no sign of the Fork.	
FormID: 0005EED6	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	The Knights of Order have returned as foretold. Arden-Sul save us!	
FormID: 0005EEDE	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Souless Knights on the prowl, they say. Better carry a weapon with you. Wouldn't want you to get hurt.	
FormID: 0005EEE8	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I've heard The Fringe has been attacked. I hope the residents were able to escape in time.	
FormID: 0005EEF7	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I heard the Fringe was attacked. I don't yet know exactly how many were lost, but I'll have to find out.	
FormID: 0005EEF9	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I heard the Fringe was under attack. Sheer-Meedish is probably worried. I should talk to her.	
FormID: 0005EEFA	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Oh, my word! The Fringe, gone? Luckily, Sheogorath will protect us. He always does.	
FormID: 0005EF03	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I heard Passwall has been destroyed. Damn shame. Used to drink with some of those folks.	
FormID: 0005EF04	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	The Fringe attacked? This may be our last day alive. Let's make the most of it.	
FormID: 0005EF0E	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	During these terrible times, I think people need juggling more than ever to take their minds off their troubles.	
FormID: 0005EF14	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Passwall is in ruins. I should see what they left behind.	
FormID: 0005EF1A	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	The Fringe has been destroyed. Who knows what could happen next? I'll have to work quickly to get my affairs in order.	
FormID: 0005EF1B	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	The Fringe has been laid to waste! I do hope none of my poor children were caught up in it.	
FormID: 0005F1E2	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Heard there's a new Gatekeeper. Spends all day by that huge wall. It's bound to fall in on him.	deathly afraid of walls falling on him
FormID: 0005F1E3	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Gatekeeper at the Gates! Singing songs of gatekeeping!	
FormID: 0005F1E4	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Arden-Sul has heard our plea, and delivered the Gatekeeper back to us. We're saved!	
FormID: 0005F1E5	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I guess things will go back to normal now that there is a new Gatekeeper. Oh well, I was looking forward to some drama.	
FormID: 0005F1E6	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Between the Gatekeeper and the Resonator of Judgment, I feel much safer in New Sheoth right now.	
FormID: 0005F1E7	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I understand there's a new Gatekeeper. Rebuilt much faster this time around, unless I'm mistaken. And I never am.	
FormID: 0005F1E8	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper walks again. He'll help keep Sheer-Meedish safe.	
FormID: 0005F1E9	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	So, the Gatekeeper is back at its post... good. Now we all may be able to get things done around here.	
FormID: 0005F1EA	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Let's drink to the health of the new Gatekeeper!	
FormID: 0005F1EB	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Yes, I know the Gatekeeper is back, but so what? He's missing the best parts, so what's the point?	
FormID: 0005F1EE	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I'm working on a new act where I juggle arms and legs -- in honor of the new Gatekeeper, you see.	
FormID: 0005F1F0	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper has been reborn. I wonder if there are pieces left over....	
FormID: 0005F1F7	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	They can build a new Gatekeeper, but I can't manage to get anything done. I'm over-tasked, I tell you.	
FormID: 0005F1F8	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I should speak to someone about the new Gatekeeper. Don't want him killing any of my little ones trying to return to me.	
FormID: 0005F3DF	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Lord Sheogorath's armies are back! Maybe they'll fix some of these buildings so they don't collapse on people.	deathly afraid of walls falling on him
FormID: 0005F3E3	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Armies of Our Lord are singing again! Bells ringing! Singing! Singing!	
FormID: 0005F3E4	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Armies restored or not, I will not let an enemy of the Maniacs set foot in the Sacellum.	
FormID: 0005F3E5	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Those Golden Saint and Dark Seducer men are dreamy aren't they? Glad to have them back.	
FormID: 0005F3E6	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Lord Sheogorath's mood seems improved now that he has an army at his back.	
FormID: 0005F3E8	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Good to see the armies back. Did you know that the average Saint is exactly six feet tall?	
FormID: 0005F3E9	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath's armies again can protect sweet Sheer-Meedish.	
FormID: 0005F3EA	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Armies, war? Bah! When it comes to a man's heart, a basket of sweetrolls can be as effective as a sword.	
FormID: 0005F3EB	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Our Lord's armies are at full strength. A toast to Our Lord!	
FormID: 0005F3EC	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Army, eh? Ohhhh... that means it's time to play [QUOTE]interrogate the innocent female prisoner[QUOTE] again! Great.	
FormID: 0005F3EE	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I'll soon be unveiling an entirely new act. [QUOTE]Silence Over Brellach: A Juggling Epic.[QUOTE] I think you'll agree it's my finest work.	
FormID: 0005F3EF	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath's armies have returned. They'll protect me while I protect my belongings.	
FormID: 0005F3F2	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Perhaps now that our guards are restored, things will quiet down and I'll actually be able to get something done.	
FormID: 0005F3F3	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I can rest easier now, knowing that my children are all better protected.	
FormID: 0006032F	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Even Sheogorath knows it's not safe here. Probably afraid of the buildings falling in on him.	deathly afraid of walls falling on him
FormID: 00060330	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Where is Our Lord? Does he go to get the Fork?	
FormID: 00060365	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath has left us to think for ourselves and to turn to Arden-Sul's teachings for enlightenment.	
FormID: 0006036A	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Where has Sheogorath gone? Mama always said, [QUOTE]The Prince of Madness is a basket of riddles.[QUOTE]	
FormID: 0006036C	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath may be gone, but I will still serve the House of Mania until my death.	
FormID: 00060383	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I'm rather curious about this disappearance of Sheogorath's. Is he incorporeal, invisible, or has he moved to another plane?	
FormID: 0006038F	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Where has Sheogorath gone? Does he not realize the danger Sheer-Meedish is in?	
FormID: 00060391	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath has vanished? I certainly hope it had nothing to do with the Greenmote Upsidedown Cake I sent to the Castle.	
FormID: 00060399	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath is missing. A drink in his order is in honor. Honor is in order. Whatever.	
FormID: 0006039B	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath gone? I'd check the bedchambers of every maiden in town... you'll find Him eventually.	
FormID: 0006039F	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	All my patrons keep disappearing! It's impossible to create important art under these conditions!	
FormID: 000603A0	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Our Lord is missing? Perhaps I should get his things. To keep them safe.	
FormID: 000603A9	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Maybe it's not worth doing any more work. I mean, it certainly seems like we're all doomed. What's the point?	
FormID: 0006041F	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I've tried to tell all my children to flee the Realm while they still can, but none listen to me!	
FormID: 0006079E	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	The Greymarch is over. Sheogorath has defeated Jyggalag! The whole world almost collapsed on us! But it didn't!	deathly afraid of walls falling on him
FormID: 000607A3	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Order is defeated! Triumph for us all! Songs of gladness!	
FormID: 000607A5	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Order has been destroyed and we still stand! Joy and tidings to all!	
FormID: 000607A6	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Order has been defeated. I'm glad that's over. Mama always said, [QUOTE]The end of the world only happens once.[QUOTE] 	
FormID: 000607A7	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	The Greymarch is complete and the House of Mania still stands tall.	
FormID: 000607A8	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	I lost track of the number of times I looked at the sky, waiting for the world to end.	
FormID: 000607A9	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Order is defeated, and Sheer-Meedish is safe. Praise Sheogorath!	
FormID: 000607AA	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	The day is ours! Come and celebrate, we will feast and dine until we can eat no more!	
FormID: 000607B2	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	A toast to Sheogorath! Order is no more.	
FormID: 000607B3	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Now that this is all over, I feel like celebrating. Care to take a number?	
FormID: 000607B4	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Art has triumphed! I plan to dedicate my next juggling epic to Sheogorath's glorious victory!	
FormID: 000607B5	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Order is gone! They didn't leave anything interesting behind, though.	
FormID: 000607B7	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	Finally, all this mess is sorted out. I can get back to my work. Oh, I've lost so much time.	
FormID: 000607BA	SENQDMania	INFOGENERAL	0	The Realm is a safe haven for all my hatchlings once more. If only I could get them to appreciate me.	
FormID: 00041ECB	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	A new adventurer in the Isles. Perhaps it's a sign?	
FormID: 00042D91	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Someone new in the Isles? Oh no, I don't want that. Perhaps Syl will put a stop to it.	
FormID: 00042D94	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Any new entry to the Shivering Isles is the chance for a new convert. I welcome it.	
FormID: 00042D95	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Newcomers are entering the Shivering Isles. With new people comes new treasure!	
FormID: 00042D98	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	A new adventurer in the Isles. Perhaps this adventurer has some Skooma?	addicted to a drug called Skooma
FormID: 00042D93	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	There's a new person in the Isles. I wonder what his blood tastes like?	A creepy, slow, sensual drawl. 
FormID: 00042D9C	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I've heard that there are new adventurers coming. I wonder what new discoveries they will bring to us.	
FormID: 00042D9D	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I hear there's someone new in the Shivering Isles. I do so enjoy making new friends.	
FormID: 00042DA0	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I heard about this new person in the Isles. There's one more person who'll come to hate my guts. I hope he kills me.	
FormID: 00042DA1	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The last thing the Realm needs is one more vagabond sneaking in.	
FormID: 00042DA4	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Someone new is trying to get into the Shivering Isles. I'd better hide what little I have left.	
FormID: 00042DA5	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I hear there's someone trying to get into the Shivering Isles. It's all part of a plot to overthrow the Realm. You'll see.	
FormID: 00042DA8	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Someone different come to the Isles? Don't like to think what kind of diseases came along.	
FormID: 00042DA9	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Rumor has it there's another adventurer trying to get into the Realm. One more person to take up arms against me!	
FormID: 00042DAC	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	That newcomer... I know I heard his name the other day, but I can't seem to remember....	
FormID: 00042DAD	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Someone new around? Not one of those horrible cats, I hope.	
FormID: 000434AC	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper dead. Can the rest of us be far behind?	
FormID: 000434AF	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper, dead! This could be the end for all of us!	
FormID: 000434B0	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The new arrival to our land has slain the Gatekeeper! A fine candidate for the Demented!	
FormID: 000434B3	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	They're saying that the Gatekeeper has been killed. Was it you? Did you do it? Did you get anything good from him?	
FormID: 000434B4	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper has been slain. That calls for a bit of Skooma, don't you think? I need a fix of Skooma! Please! You got some Skooma?	addicted to a drug called Skooma
FormID: 000434B7	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	It's only a matter of time before adventurers swarm the Isles now that the Gatekeeper is killed. You'll need a sharp blade to bleed them.	A creepy, slow, sensual drawl. 
FormID: 000434B8	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	It's a shame, really. The Gatekeeper was a beautiful specimen. Now he'll just rot and fade like everything else.	
FormID: 000434BB	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper's been killed, I hear. Now who knows what new faces I'll get a chance to mangle.	
FormID: 000434BC	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Someone killed the Gatekeeper? Do you know who? Maybe he'll kill me too. Do you think? I hope so. Someone put me out of my misery, please!	
FormID: 000434BF	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper is dead. One more sign that the Realm is being run into the ground. This never should've happened.	
FormID: 000434C0	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I heard the Gatekeeper is dead. He didn't have any of my things on him, though, so it's no matter.	
FormID: 000434C3	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper's been killed, you know. Uncle Leo is most distressed, but I'm thrilled. Can't wait to find out who's behind it.	
FormID: 000434C4	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper has died. Wonder what got him. Collywobbles? Greenspore?	
FormID: 000434C8	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper's been killed. This is only the first step; they'll be coming for me next.	
FormID: 000434C9	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I would love to get a piece of the old Gatekeeper for my Museum. His head maybe, or an arm... he certainly was a unique specimen.	
FormID: 000434CD	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper is dead? Who will keep out the cats? They'll be everywhere!	
FormID: 000434D0	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Resonator has been reactivated. Why, if not to protect us from the coming storm?	
FormID: 000434D3	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Hearing that the Resonator works again almost makes up for losing the Gatekeeper. We're still not safe, though.	
FormID: 000434D6	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Once more the Isles are protected by the will of Arden-Sul.	
FormID: 000434D9	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Resonator is fixed again. What a shame. I looked forward to meeting new people. They always have such nice things.	
FormID: 000434DC	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	That Adventurer-Attractor-Thingy is working again. You know what's attracting me? The Skooma!	addicted to a drug called Skooma
FormID: 000434DF	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I wonder if the Resonator of Judgment hurts those inside?	A creepy, slow, sensual drawl. emphasing words dealing with blood and pain.
FormID: 000434E2	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Resonator of Judgment is fixed! How horrid! New adventurers mean new exhibits!	
FormID: 000434E5	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I had rather enjoyed the Resonator being broken. Greater opportunity for meeting someone new.	
FormID: 000434E8	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Now with the Resonator of Judgment working, there won't be any adventurers running around. Who am I going to find to kill me now?	
FormID: 000434EB	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Resonator was my idea, you know. People never remember that, but it was. I'm glad it's working again.	
FormID: 000434EE	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	If the Resonator is working, it means fewer people to steal my things. More of a chance to find what I've lost. Good in my book.	
FormID: 000434F1	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	So the Resonator is working. But who fixed it? Why was it broken in the first place? Why is no one asking these questions?	
FormID: 000434F4	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Resonator is active once again? Perhaps it will draw the disease from my body.	
FormID: 000434F6	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Lord Sheogorath would do well to stop bothering with the Resonator, and just send everyone away.	
FormID: 000434F9	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	That Xedilian place just sounds positively stuffed with Oddities. Surely something could be spared for my museum?	
FormID: 000434FA	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Again the Resonator pulls men to it. But cats? No! Why? It should draw them far from here!	
FormID: 00043E84	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Chalice has been returned to Thadon. He should use it while there is still time.	
FormID: 00043E87	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	If Thadon has his Chalice back, maybe that will smooth things over between the two Houses.	
FormID: 00043E88	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Bah. I liked when Thadon was in a bad mood. Foolish Maniac.	
FormID: 00043E8B	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon has his Chalice back. I wonder if he'll let me take a look at it....	
FormID: 00043E8C	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon must be back on the Felldew... he's never tried the skooma though. Say, you got any skooma you can spare, friend?	addicted to a drug called Skooma
FormID: 00043E8F	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon's blood is so tainted. He needs to be cut open so he can let some of the toxin out.	A creepy, slow, sensual drawl. emphasing words dealing with blood and pain.
FormID: 00043E90	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	This Chalice of Reversal sounds like a horrid device. Who would want to spend their time under the effects of some... chemical?	
FormID: 00043E93	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon has his Chalice. That'll anger Syl, I'm sure, which means more work for me.	
FormID: 00043E94	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I hear Thadon's happy again. Dammit! Why is everyone so happy all the time? It's not fair. I just want to die. Is that too much to ask?	
FormID: 00043E97	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon has one less excuse for his sloppy rule over Bliss, now that he has his Chalice again.	
FormID: 00043E98	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon has his Chalice back. Why won't anyone help me replace what I've lost?	
FormID: 00043E9B	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon had outside help getting his Chalice back. Something sneaky going on there.	
FormID: 00043E9C	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	How can Thadon drink from that Chalice? Who knows what germs are on it?	
FormID: 00043E9F	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon and his Chalice can both rot in Hell, for all I care.	
FormID: 00043EA0	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Too bad someone didn't bring me this Chalice for my Museum. Would have made a fine addition to my collection.	
FormID: 00043EA3	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Chalices? Who can think about chalices with the cat problem around here? Nasty beasts.	
FormID: 00043EA4	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Syl once again tortures her courtiers. Soon, we will all suffer.	
FormID: 00043EA7	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I don't know what happened. I didn't do anything to Syl, so why was I punished?	
FormID: 00043EA8	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Torture and pain abound in Crucible, glory be!	
FormID: 00043EAB	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I once met Herdir after a misunderstanding about some candlesticks in Syl's great hall. He's not a bad fellow, actually. 	
FormID: 00043EAC	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Syl's rounding up people again. I better go stash my Skooma. Or... I would if I had some. You have any?	addicted to a drug called Skooma
FormID: 00043EAF	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Syl is a paranoid fool. She could torture me as much as she'd like, though. Cut intricate patterns into my skin. I shiver just thinking about it.	A creepy, slow, sensual drawl. emphasing words dealing with blood and pain.
FormID: 00043EB0	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	All this talk of torture has me thinking -- would it be possible to hold someone in time during their most painful moment?	
FormID: 00043EB3	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	My, but it has been busy here lately. I do so enjoy a good conspiracy.	
FormID: 00043EB4	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Syl's torturing people? To death, I hope? It was me. I did it, whatever it was. Come take me away and kill me. I'm the culprit.	
FormID: 00043EB7	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	This is preposterous. Were I in charge, the culprits would've been found and executed immediately.	
FormID: 00043EB8	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I don't suppose during all this torture anyone asked about where my things have gotten to. Or who stole them.	
FormID: 00043EBA	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I had just been telling Uncle Leo that something big was coming, and now this conspiracy. And they thought me part of it!	
FormID: 00043EBB	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I heard something strange happened in the House of Dementia. Probably disease-related.	
FormID: 00043EBC	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The conspiracy has been discovered and eliminated. That is all you need know.	
FormID: 00043EBD	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I could have told Syl who the traitor was, if only I could remember! Damn my failing mind!	
FormID: 00043EBE	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Torture in the House of Dementia? I'm constantly tortured! Cats everywhere.	
FormID: 000441D1	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Torch extinguished and relit? This does not bode well.	
FormID: 000441D4	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Great Torch is lit once more. Maybe we might be safe here after all.	
FormID: 000441D5	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Once again, the Great Torch burns bright as Arden-Sul foretold.	
FormID: 000441D8	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Torch is relit. Wonderful. Just makes it a bit tougher to sneak around.	
FormID: 000441D9	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Great Torch is lit! This calls for a celebration. Break out the Skooma! You brought the Skooma, right?	addicted to a drug called Skooma
FormID: 000441DC	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I wonder if the Great Torch being lit will stop the unrest. I was getting excited about the prospect of more bloodshed. Oh, well.	A creepy, slow, sensual drawl. emphasing words dealing with blood and pain.
FormID: 000441DD	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	So, the Torch is lit. Can a flame be captured in time? Would it still burn?	
FormID: 000441E0	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Great Torch burns again. That'll boost spirits around here. A shame, really.	
FormID: 000441E1	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Great Torch is on fire again. I wonder if someone might accidentally knock me into it. Do I look flammable to you? I hope I'm flammable.	
FormID: 000441E4	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Great Torch burning again is a sign that things aren't completely hopeless. Means someone is doing something right.	
FormID: 000441E5	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I used to have a Great Torch. Where did I put it? That one is relit, which is a good thing. Mine's still missing.	
FormID: 000441E8	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	My whole family is happy about the Torch being lit. Unless it's all part of some bit plot.	
FormID: 000441E9	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Great Torch burns once more. Perhaps there's hope for all. Except me. Can't shake this cold....	
FormID: 000441EC	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Torch burns again. This can't bode well.	
FormID: 000441ED	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The question is, who gains from the Torch being relit? And who loses? That's what you should be asking yourself.	
FormID: 000441F0	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I'm glad the Great Torch burns again. Cats hate fire.	
FormID: 000441F1	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	A new ruler for Dementia. Certainly the end times are upon us.	
FormID: 000441F4	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Crucible has a new ruler. Perhaps I can continue to find shelter in the House of Dementia, else what will I do?	
FormID: 000441F5	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Ritual is complete. Arden-Sul's will is done.	
FormID: 000441F8	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	It's a shame Syl's gone. She didn't pay a lot of attention to what was going on.	
FormID: 000441F9	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Now that Syl is gone, perhaps Skooma will once again be legal!	addicted to a drug called Skooma
FormID: 000441FC	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	A new ruler for Dementia! Perhaps blood was spilled. Great deals of blood. Syl's blood. Lovely blood.	A creepy, slow, sensual drawl. emphasing words dealing with blood and pain.
FormID: 000441FD	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	A new ruler of Dementia. Excellent. If I could only freeze this moment in time.	
FormID: 000441FE	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Oh, I must say I was sorry to see Syl go. She always kept me busy, and when I'm busy, I'm ever so happy.	
FormID: 000441FF	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I've been bad, really bad. Perhaps the new leader of Dementia can sentence me to death for my crimes! Where do I sign up for that?	
FormID: 00044200	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I no longer serve Lady Syl. Crucible has a new ruler.	
FormID: 00044201	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Perhaps the new head of Dementia can do something to help people protect what's really theirs.	
FormID: 00044202	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	A replacement for the Duchess of Dementia could put the wrong people in positions of power, if you get my drift.	
FormID: 00044203	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Syl is gone, and a new ruler presides over the House of Dementia. Perhaps they can cure my malady.	
FormID: 0005DD10	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I was always perfectly loyal to the old Duchess. As I am to the new Duke, whoever it may be.	
FormID: 0005DD15	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Perhaps the new ruler of Dementia will do something about the cat problem.	
FormID: 0005ED4B	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon is gone! Perhaps things are looking up.	
FormID: 0005ED4C	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Thank Sheogorath it was Thadon who was killed, not Syl.	
FormID: 0005ED4F	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Ritual is complete. Arden-Sul's will is done.	
FormID: 0005ED50	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon gone.... I wonder if his quarters are still guarded.	
FormID: 0005ED53	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Now that Syl is gone, perhaps Skooma will once again be legal!	addicted to a drug called Skooma
FormID: 0005ED54	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I heard Thadon's heart exploded. There would have been a great deal of blood. Sweet, sweet heart's blood.	A creepy, slow, sensual drawl. emphasing words dealing with blood and pain.
FormID: 0005ED57	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon has been replaced. It is a moment worth capturing forever.	
FormID: 0005ED58	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon has died. I hope he didn't go quietly.	
FormID: 0005ED5B	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon is dead. Lucky bastard.	
FormID: 0005ED5C	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon is dead. Bliss will be even more of a mess than before.	
FormID: 0005ED6E	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Now that Thadon is dead, I should see if he had my things in his quarters.	
FormID: 0005ED74	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I heard Thadon is dead. Nothing wrong with that.	
FormID: 0005ED77	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon has passed the mantle. I heard he was in bad health, anyway, and I know how that is.	
FormID: 0005ED8A	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon is dead. I wonder if he had anything interesting for the museum....	
FormID: 0005ED8E	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	A new ruler for Mania? Great. They don't have the same cat problems we have in Dementia.	
FormID: 0005EEFF	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Passwall has been destroyed. Can the rest of the Isles be far behind?	
FormID: 0005EF08	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Fringe gone. We're next. I'm sure of it.	
FormID: 0005EF0D	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Arden-Sul preserve us! The Fringe has been destroyed!	
FormID: 0005EF17	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Did you hear? The Fringe was attacked! How horrible!	
FormID: 0005EF19	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Strange knights in the Fringe? Well, I'll drink to that!	addicted to a drug called Skooma
FormID: 0005EF1C	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Strange creatures have appeared in the Fringe... perhaps you need a new blade? A Madness blade?	A creepy, slow, sensual drawl. emphasing words dealing with blood and pain.
FormID: 0005EF26	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	They say that invaders have come to the Shivering Isles. Of course, [QUOTE]they[QUOTE] say a lot of things, don't they?	
FormID: 0005EF2C	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Fringe has been attacked. I'm more than willing to help find out who's responsible.	
FormID: 0005EF2F	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Do you think those Knights will come here? I hope they do! I'd be the first to fall before them!	
FormID: 0005EF34	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I helped save the Fringe, you know. Not directly, really, but it was ultimately thanks to me.	
FormID: 0005EF4D	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The End is coming. You just wait, you'll see. Time to gather up your things while you can.	
FormID: 0005EF53	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	It's all tied together, I'm telling you. The Fringe, the weather we've been having, the price of cheese... it's all connected!	
FormID: 0005EF56	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Order has attacked Passwall. Probably brought horrible disease with them, as well.	
FormID: 0005EF57	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Of course the Fringe was destroyed. This is how the Greymarch always begins, you know.	
FormID: 0005EF6E	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Fringe is under attack! Probably a cat conspiracy.	
FormID: 0005F1EC	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper protects us once again. But, can he protect us from the coming horror?	
FormID: 0005F1ED	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper has been rebuilt, which means the Realm is a little safer for now.	
FormID: 0005F1F5	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper has returned to its former glory... Arden-Sul blesses us once more.	
FormID: 0005F1F6	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper has been rebuilt. I wonder if I could get a little piece of the old one.	
FormID: 0005F1FD	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	There's a new Gatekeeper. That calls for a toast. Pass the Skooma!	addicted to a drug called Skooma
FormID: 0005F1FE	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I've heard that the new Gatekeeper is fearsome. The ground will soon be red with the blood of those that would challenge him.	A creepy, slow, sensual drawl. emphasing words dealing with blood and pain.
FormID: 0005F202	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	That flesh monstrosity that patrols the Fringe has been rebuilt. Better to let it stay dead if you ask me.	
FormID: 0005F203	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Quite a shame that there's a new Gatekeeper. I'd been hoping to meet a few more friendly faces.	
FormID: 0005F205	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	A new Gatekeeper, eh? I'll bet he'd be willing to kill me!	
FormID: 0005F208	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Rebuilding the Gatekeeper is one of the few things that has gone right lately.	
FormID: 0005F20A	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	They built a new Gatekeeper, did they? Hope they didn't use anything of mine when putting him back together.	
FormID: 0005F20B	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	There's a new Gatekeeper guarding the Realm. Uncle Leo thinks it's too little, too late, but I disagree.	
FormID: 0005F20D	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	A new Gatekeeper protects the Fringe. But he does nothing to stop the spread of disease.	
FormID: 0005F20E	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Always nice to have a new Gatekeeper. I hope that when this one gets killed, someone thinks to bring me something for the Museum.	
FormID: 0005F20F	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The new Gatekeeper will keep out those horrible Khajiit.	
FormID: 0005F3ED	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath's armies are at full strength once more. They will be needed in times ahead.	
FormID: 0005F3F0	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The realm has regained an army. Let's hope it can protect us.	
FormID: 0005F3F1	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	By the grace of Arden-Sul, the armies have returned.	
FormID: 0005F3F4	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The armies of Sheogorath march again!	
FormID: 0005F3F7	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The armies are restored? That calls for a celebration!	addicted to a drug called Skooma
FormID: 0005F3FB	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Our Lord has His armies restored. They carry such wonderfully sharp blades.	A creepy, slow, sensual drawl. emphasing words dealing with blood and pain.
FormID: 0005F3FC	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	If the newly restored armies need conscripts, I could be persuaded to enlist a few of my exhibits. 	
FormID: 0005F416	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	No precious army will bring back Lady Syl. Without her, who will let me do what I do best?	
FormID: 0005F41E	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath's army is restored? I should find them. They'd be sure to kill me.	
FormID: 0005F41F	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I'm not saying I couldn't do a better job, but at least someone is in charge who can get things done.	
FormID: 0005F420	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	It's about time someone restores some order around here.	
FormID: 0005F425	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Who would want an entire army destroyed, and for what purpose? I know there's something big going on.	
FormID: 0005F427	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Daedric armies are whole again. If only I could live to see them in battle. The chills are getting worse, though.	
FormID: 0005F428	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	It was truly shocking. The guards just dropped dead, all across the city! I'm glad it's over, but it makes you wonder, doesn't it?	
FormID: 0005F42A	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The armies of Sheogorath are renewed. Let them march now on the horrible cats! Wipe them from the Isles!	
FormID: 000603A2	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath is gone. This can only mean the end is near.	
FormID: 000603A8	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Maybe there really is no place left to hide. We are truly doomed if the attempts to find Him fail.	
FormID: 00060507	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Have we been forsaken? What has happened to Sheogorath? Arden-Sul, guide me in this time of need!	
FormID: 00060508	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath is gone? If he is gone, then who is watching us?	
FormID: 00060509	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	They say our Lord just took off. Can you believe that? I need a drink. I need the Skooma.	addicted to a drug called Skooma
FormID: 0006050A	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath is gone. Better carry a blade, just in case. Use it on your enemies, if things get bad. Or on yourself, if things get worse.	A creepy, slow, sensual drawl. emphasing words dealing with blood and pain.
FormID: 0006050B	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Madgod has vanished? Perhaps He simply stepped out of our time until the Greymarch passes.	
FormID: 0006050C	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	With the whole Realm in jeopardy, my days of work may be at an end. How truly sad.	
FormID: 00060512	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath is gone. Maybe I kidnapped him. That would merit a death sentence!	
FormID: 00060514	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I can say without hesitation that none of this is my fault. Could've told you it was coming, though.	
FormID: 0006051A	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Just when I thought I was making some progress, I hear that Sheogorath himself has gone missing. Is this the end?	
FormID: 0006051E	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I know what the next sign is. You'll see it, mark my words. All efforts to save us will fail, because that's how this will all end.	
FormID: 00060520	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath gone, and me not far behind. I think this cold will finally be the death of me.	
FormID: 00060521	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath hasn't disappeared. Did you know that he and Jyggalag are the same person? It's all very hard to understand.	
FormID: 00060526	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Where has Sheogorath gone? Who will save us from the cats? Won't someone think of the cats?	
FormID: 000607B6	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The forces of Order are no more. What horror will replace them?	
FormID: 000607C0	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Greymarch is over. At least I'll be able to sleep a little safer now.	
FormID: 000607C1	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	So, the story has been rewritten and the Greymarch is at a new ending. Arden-Sul's will be done.	
FormID: 000607C8	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Do you know the best part about the end of a war? Picking the bodies clean of their treasure.	
FormID: 000607C9	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Victory over Order! That calls for a grand celebration. Break out the casks of Skooma!	addicted to a drug called Skooma
FormID: 000607CA	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I thought we were all doomed for a while there. I carved my last will and testament, but I won't say where.	A creepy, slow, sensual drawl. emphasing words dealing with blood and pain.
FormID: 000607CC	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	The Greymarch is over, the war has been won, but at what cost? This timeline will never be the same.	
FormID: 000607CE	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Now that things are returning to normal, it's high time I prepare my chamber for some new visitors.	
FormID: 000607CF	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	An invading army sweeps the land, there's a giant battle in the palace, and yet I'm still alive. How did I not die during all that? It's not fair.	
FormID: 000607D0	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	You know, of course, that the Realm would still be in jeopardy were it not for me.	
FormID: 000607D1	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Just because the Isles didn't come crashing down around our heads doesn't mean everything is fine.	
FormID: 000607D3	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I suspect this whole Greymarch fiasco is a cover-up for something more sinister. I can't prove it just yet, though.	
FormID: 000607D4	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Order is defeated! I think I actually feel a little better. No... I don't.	
FormID: 000607D5	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	I hope someone saved a piece of Jyggalag's armor. Just the thing for my museum!	
FormID: 000607DF	SENQDDementia	INFOGENERAL	0	Order is defeated, but the cats still prey on us all.	
FormID: 000432B9	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I certainly haven't heard there's a new adventurer trying to get into the Realm.	pathologically lying

FormID: 000432BB	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	There's someone new in the Shivering Isles. One more person to worry about.	
FormID: 000432BC	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I hear the newcomer made a real mess in Passwall. I sure hope he stays out of Highcross.	
FormID: 000432BD	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Newcomers to the isles, you say? Bah! Unless they're here to work my farms, I couldn't care less.	
FormID: 000432BE	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	A new person in town? Maybe someone to talk to on long, sleepless nights.	sleepily
FormID: 000432BF	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	There's someone new in the Realm. One more interloper to watch out for.	
FormID: 000432C0	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Whoever this new person in the Isles is, he'd better steer clear of Deepwallow.	
FormID: 000432C1	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	A new person wandering around? Did anyone check to see if this person was diseased?	deathly afraid of germs
FormID: 000432C2	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	A door has opened to the Realm, and a single man steps through. Will he come to us full of lies, or will his intentions be true?	
FormID: 000432C3	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Some new person has arrived. It'd be polite to introduce myself, but I'm feeling more tired than usual.	
FormID: 000432C4	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I've heard some new person has arrived in the Realm. I simply don't have the time to meet somebody new.	
FormID: 000432C5	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	There's a new adventurer in the Isles. I've only counted three dead adventurers before. Maybe this one will make one more.	
FormID: 000432C6	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	1, 2.. A new person has come to the Isles... 4, 5... recently.	
FormID: 000432C7	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Any new adventurer trying to get into the Isles will have a tough time going up against the Gatekeeper.	
FormID: 000432C8	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	What do you want? You a big mouthed gossip? Fine. I hear there's a new arrival. You happy now? Why don't you bother someone else?	
FormID: 000432C9	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Why'd the adventurer walk through the Gates of Madness? To get to the other side!	
FormID: 000432CA	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The new adventurers! I've seen them! One is as tall as a mountain! Another is composed of pure sound and light!	
FormID: 000432CB	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	They say there's a newcomer about. I wonder where he's from?	
FormID: 000432CC	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper should take care of anyone who doesn't belong.	
FormID: 000432CD	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	New adventurers? New slaves for Cindanwe, you mean. If you see them, tell them to steer clear of Fellmoor.	
FormID: 000432CE	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Newcomers mean new pests. New pests mean more blood! More blood means a very busy Relan....	
FormID: 000432CF	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	My child will smash to a bloody pulp any adventurer who tries to get into the realm.	haughty, arrogant, and cruel
FormID: 000432D0	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Have you met the newcomer, yet? Rich, maybe? Kindhearted, or just another skinflint?	
FormID: 000432D1	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I'd like to see this new adventurer try to make it past the Gatekeeper.	
FormID: 000432D2	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Who cares if a new adventurer will be in our Realm soon, he wouldn't wish to hear what I have to say anyway.	
FormID: 000432D3	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Don't hurt me, okay? Do you want a bone? I'll tell you a secret. They say a new adventurer has come. Don't bite me!	
FormID: 000432D4	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I hear a new puppy dog has arrived on the Isles. I bet he's really cute and cuddly. Like you!	
FormID: 000432D5	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I don't have time to deal with adventurers entering the Isles, I have a painting to finish!	
FormID: 000434C6	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	That Gatekeeper is tough. He's still alive. He killed that adventurer trying to get in. So, we're all still perfectly safe.	pathologically lying
FormID: 000434CA	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper's dead. Must have had some curse or weakness. There always is. Heroes kill monsters by exploiting a weakness.	addicted to reading books and fairytales
FormID: 000434CE	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper's been killed. Now we're even more exposed to attack.	
FormID: 000434CF	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	With the Gatekeeper gone, it's only a matter of time before we have every manner of riff-raff swarming into the Isles.	
FormID: 000434D4	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	This business with the Gatekeeper is appalling. Can no one maintain order around here? 	
FormID: 000434D5	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Business isn't going to be the same, now that anyone can just wander into the Isles.	sleepily
FormID: 000434DA	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	With the Gatekeeper dead, there's one less line of defense against these damnable Scalons.	
FormID: 000434DB	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	You know who's responsible for killing the Gatekeeper, don't you? It's Them.	
FormID: 000434E0	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper has been slain. I bet he died of a disease. I hope someone takes care of his corpse. Can you imagine how disgusting that will be?	deathly afraid of germs
FormID: 000434E1	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The great guardian is dead and gone, his spirit passed away. I wonder if the stranger and I shall cross paths soon some day.	
FormID: 000434E6	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper is dead. Just great. Who's going to protect us now? I sure hope I don't have to move. I hate moving. It's depressing.	
FormID: 000434E7	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Whoever killed the Gatekeeper must have been dedicated and hard working. That reminds me... it's time I get back to work.	
FormID: 000434EC	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I've never seen a dead Gatekeeper. I should add him to my list. Did I ever tell you I've counted over a 900 dead rats...?	
FormID: 000434ED	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	1, 2... Did you hear? The Gatekeeper is dead.... 4, 5... That's bad news... 7, 8.	
FormID: 000434F2	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper is dead. He's got really big bones.	
FormID: 000434F3	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Some idiot killed the Gatekeeper. Now we'll be swamped with morons coming and bothering us. Present company not excluded.	
FormID: 000434F7	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	What do you get when you cross an adventurer with the Gatekeeper? A dead Gatekeeper!	
FormID: 000434F8	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Do you want to know a secret? It was I who killed the Gatekeeper. I poisoned him with an apple!	
FormID: 000434FB	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I'll have to update my encyclopedia. I had an entire volume devoted to the Gatekeeper, and now he's dead.	
FormID: 000434FC	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper's dead. I hope I get to help rebuild a new one.	
FormID: 000434FD	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	People keep saying that the Gatekeeper is dead. I have no idea what that means. Do you know?	
FormID: 000434FE	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Mighty warrior, the fallen Gatekeeper. Relan wonders if he would be able to do the same.	
FormID: 000434FF	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Someone killed my poor child! And my Lord cares little. So be it. Let the adventurers in. I don't care anymore.	haughty, arrogant, and cruel
FormID: 00043500	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Hey, did you hear the Gatekeeper is dead? That's valuable information, don't you think? Worth a few coins?	
FormID: 00043501	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper was killed. Nobody asked me if I thought that was a good idea. Well, I do.	
FormID: 00043502	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The mighty Gatekeeper has fallen. Fallen like my heart on a cold winter's day.	
FormID: 00043503	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper is dead. Did you kill him? You've got awfully sharp looking teeth. Don't eat me. Please!	
FormID: 00043504	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Aren't you a cute little caterpillar! The Gatekeeper is dead. But he won't turn into a butterfly. No, he won't. Will he?	
FormID: 00043505	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Perhaps I should dedicate a portrait to the Gatekeeper in honor of his death.	
FormID: 00043506	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Resonator is still broken. It never worked. And it never will.	pathologically lying
FormID: 00043507	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Resonator of Judgment is back on. I read about that somewhere. It helps keep the Realm clean of vagrants and ne'er-do-wells.	addicted to reading books and fairytales
FormID: 00043508	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I wish we had a Resonator of something-or-other. We're certainly not safe as it is.	
FormID: 00043509	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I'm glad that the Resonator is working again. Enough riff-raff around this place already.	
FormID: 0004350A	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Everyone is talking about that damned Resonator of Judgment -- talking instead of working.	
FormID: 0004350B	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Resonator of Judgment is working again. I guess, since the Gatekeeper's dead now, that's a good thing.	sleepily
FormID: 0004350C	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Resonator of Judgment is working again. Big deal; if it doesn't work on Scalons, doesn't do us a lick of good.	
FormID: 0004350D	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Even if the Resonator of Judgment is working again, I bet it won't deter Them. I'm still not safe.	
FormID: 0004350E	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	That Resonator is up and running again. It traps adventurers like the disease-infected rats that they are.	deathly afraid of germs
FormID: 0004350F	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Resonator sings again, drawing strangers near. Protecting us, our lives, our homes, and all that we hold dear.	
FormID: 00043510	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Someone managed to turn the Resonator back on. I guess that's a good thing. Though it sounds like a lot of work for little pay off to me.	
FormID: 00043511	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Glad they got the Resonator of Judgment turned back on. Was getting less done with all the hubbub about adventurers running amok.	
FormID: 00043512	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I bet there's plenty of corpses to count in Xedilian.	
FormID: 00043513	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	1, 2... Adventurers are being sucked up into that dungeon again... 5, 6.	
FormID: 00043514	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	That Resonator keeps adventurers trapped until they die. Lots of bones in there.	
FormID: 00043515	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I hate gossips. If I tell you something, will you go away? Fine. The Resonator of Judgment is on again. Blah.	
FormID: 00043516	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	So the moral of the story is: don't count your adventurers until they hatch! Ha!	
FormID: 00043517	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Truth be told, the Resonator of Judgment doesn't actually do anything. Who cares if it's been reactivated?	
FormID: 00043518	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I suspect that the Resonator is affecting the migration patterns of baliwogs, but it's going to take years of study to be sure.	
FormID: 00043519	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	It's good that Resonator of Judgment is working again, what with the Gatekeeper dead and everything. Did you hear that noise?	
FormID: 0004351A	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Did you hear? The Resonator of Judgment is active once again. I don't trust anything that can influence the thoughts of others.	
FormID: 0004351B	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	People are talking about a Resonator. Unless it makes more pests to kill, Relan does not care.	
FormID: 0004351C	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Foolish adventurers are being pulled into the Resonator of Judgment.	haughty, arrogant, and cruel
FormID: 0004351D	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	This Resonator thing-a-ma-jig. I don't get it. What's it for, anyway?	
FormID: 0004351E	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Adventurers are being sucked up by that Xedilian place again.	
FormID: 0004351F	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Just when I look forward to company, they activate the Resonator. Tall-Trees-Falling is so alone.	
FormID: 00043520	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Yikes! To bad that Resonator of Judgment doesn't get rid of troublesome beasts. I bet you could swallow me whole, couldn't you?	
FormID: 00043521	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Resonator is attracting again. Aren't you a cute little thing? Do you want me to scratch behind your ears?	
FormID: 00043522	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I began a painting of the Resonator of Judgment many years ago. I wonder if I ever finished it?	
FormID: 00043EBF	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon isn't really addicted to Felldew. Felldew is perfectly safe. There's nothing magical about his special cup either.	pathologically lying
FormID: 00043EC0	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon has his Chalice back. In the stories, men are always off in search of some sword or a cup of some kind.	addicted to reading books and fairytales
FormID: 00043EC1	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Will Thadon's Chalice make Deepwallow any safer for me? No? Then I don't care.	
FormID: 00043EC2	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Duke Thadon's got his happy juice back, I hear. Good for him. He's always kept things very orderly. I like him.	
FormID: 00043EC3	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Honestly, who cares if that noble brat Thadon has his toy Chalice? 	
FormID: 00043EC4	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I wonder if people dream when they take Felldew. Hmmm.	sleepily
FormID: 00043EC5	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Chalice of Reversal is back in Thadon's hands, I hear. Wonder if it could be used as a blunt weapon.	
FormID: 00043EC6	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Must be nice to be Duke of Mania, and have your biggest problem surround some missing cup.	
FormID: 00043EC7	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon better not drink out of that Chalice. Who knows how many people have used it while it was missing? Reusing cups is the best way to get sick.	deathly afraid of germs
FormID: 00043EC8	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The cup of Thadon is back in hand, a vessel full of dew. It seems someone helped him find it, someone who is new.	
FormID: 00043EC9	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	You know, I need to get me a habit like Thadon. Might take the edge off. Life can be so hard. Makes me want to cry all the time.	
FormID: 00043ECA	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon's got his cup back? Isn't that nice? I certainly can't lay around drifting on Felldew all day. I've got too many important things to do.	
FormID: 00043ECB	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon's back to his old self, I hear. He gets moody when he's not on the Felldew. He had two people killed. I know. I counted them.	
FormID: 00043ECC	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	5, 6... Thadon's back on the Felldew... 7, 8... without the downer... 10, 11.	
FormID: 00043ECD	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	They say Thadon is addicted to some drug. I can understand what that's like. The bones call to me like his drug calls to him.	
FormID: 00043ECE	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon's got his cup. The world's back in order. I get it. So then why the hell are you still here bothering me? Get lost!	
FormID: 00043ECF	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	So the addict says to the whore, [QUOTE]Gimme back my Chalice of Reversal![QUOTE] Ha ha!	
FormID: 00043ED0	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	There is more to Thadon and Syl than they let on. Let's just say... well. You know.	
FormID: 00043ED1	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Everyone's talking about Duke Thadon and his Chalice. How tedious. Don't people understand I have important work to finish?	
FormID: 00043ED2	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon is addicted to Felldew. I stay away from drugs. A sorceress needs a clear mind. Hey, do you hear those dogs barking? They're so loud!	
FormID: 00043ED3	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon finally has his precious Chalice. But, such things do not matter to those of us who work for a living.	
FormID: 00043ED4	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Relan hears of this Reversal Chalice. It makes blood special, yes? Relan would like special blood.	
FormID: 00043ED5	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon's a fool. Who cares about his precious Chalice?	haughty, arrogant, and cruel
FormID: 00043ED6	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Here's one you haven't heard, I bet. The Duke's got his Chalice back. Hmm? See what I mean? Now, what can you do for me?	
FormID: 00043ED7	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon has his Chalice back. Doesn't he know a good leader doesn't need any of that? Just his native intelligence. I would know.	
FormID: 00043ED8	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon is in high spirits now? I'm glad someone is.	
FormID: 00043ED9	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Did Thadon send you? Oh... I forgot he's happy again. Well, who sent you then? My word, your pinchers are huge! Stay back!	
FormID: 00043EDA	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Oh, listen to you... a talking bird! How sweet. Did you know that Thadon's back to his old self? Fly away now! Be free!	
FormID: 00043EDB	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon's new mood after recovering his Chalice is quite nice.	
FormID: 00043EDC	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Syl never has anyone tortured. She's a gentle and kind leader. She trusts everyone, and is therefore trustworthy.	pathologically lying
FormID: 00043EDD	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	There's another mystery in House Dementia. Someone needs to write a book about that place. It'd be a best seller. Lots of intrigue!	addicted to reading books and fairytales
FormID: 00043EDE	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Another round of torture in Crucible? At least if you're in a cell, no one can sneak up on you.	
FormID: 00043EDF	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Paranoid Duchess is at it again, from what I hear. If you ask me, we could do for a little more law and order around here, too.	
FormID: 00043EE0	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The petty worries of lords and dukes mean nothing to me. Syl could torture her entire court to death for all I care.	
FormID: 00043EE1	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	If you go to New Sheoth, beware. Syl has been rounding people up and asking them strange questions.	sleepily
FormID: 00043EE2	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Why can't they send someone here to torture the Scalons? More important than courtiers, if you ask me.	
FormID: 00043EE3	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	If I thought I could make the trip safely, I'd go to Crucible and find out if the torture revealed anything about Them.	
FormID: 00043EE4	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Syl has been known to round up people for [QUOTE]questioning[QUOTE] from time to time. Torture devices are known to spread disease.	deathly afraid of germs
FormID: 00043EE5	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Once again, the Lady Syl strikes hard among her own. Her paranoia hasn't faded, in fact it's greatly grown.	
FormID: 00043EE6	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Syl likes torturing people, doesn't she? But, there's really no point in lying. I mean, it takes too much energy to keep it all straight.	
FormID: 00043EE7	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I can't imagine how anyone can get anything done in Crucible, if they keep getting dragged off for questioning by Syl.	
FormID: 00043EE8	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I was once in Syl's interrogation cell. I counted 35 dead rats in there. Of course, I had to kill a couple to get the count that high.	
FormID: 00043EE9	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	8, 9... Syl's rounding people up again. 10, 11... It's hard to count when you are being tortured.	
FormID: 00043EEA	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	They round up people like animals in New Sheoth. I should hunt those nobles. That's what I should do.	
FormID: 00043EEB	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Look. I don't like you. Why are you bothering me? Maybe I'll ask Syl to round you up for questioning. Would you like that? Go away.	
FormID: 00043EEC	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	So the spy says to her, [QUOTE]You're not paranoid if everyone's out to get you![QUOTE] Ha! Like Syl! Paranoid! Ha!	
FormID: 00043EED	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I think that I would like to be tortured. Perhaps I should go see Syl.	
FormID: 00043EEE	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The palace intrigues of the House of Dementia are of no interest to me.	
FormID: 00043EEF	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Syl likes torturing people. She's got nothing on the methods of Sorceress Verenim, though. She's a genius with pain.	
FormID: 00043EF1	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Once again, Syl uses pain to get what she wants. How long before every one of us is forced to visit Herdir's chamber?	
FormID: 00043EF2	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Relan hears of Syl's torture. Relan likes what he hears. Syl is good.	
FormID: 00043EF3	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Syl enjoys having people tortured. She's a rank amateur. I could teach her a few things.	haughty, arrogant, and cruel
FormID: 00043EF4	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	This'd be a good time to have a friend with an ear to the ground, what with all the crazy goings-ons in Crucible, you know what I mean?	
FormID: 00043EF5	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Syl's really suspicious of other people. I bet she's the one with something to hide.	
FormID: 00043EF6	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Hearing rumors of Syl's madness makes me glad I live outside the walls of New Sheoth.	
FormID: 00043EF7	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Ugh. Not again. Whatever Syl accused me of, I'm innocent. Don't hurt me. Wow, I've never seen such a big wolf before! Scary.	
FormID: 00043EF8	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	A little bird told me that Syl is rounding up people again. That's silly, isn't it? Would you like some milk, little kitty? You look thirsty.	
FormID: 00043EF9	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I don't have time to deal with Syl and her paranoid ways.	
FormID: 00044204	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Great Torch is out again! I bet you didn't know that!	pathologically lying
FormID: 00044205	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Great Torch is lit in the Sacellum Arden-Sul. Have you read the book about Arden-Sul? It's fascinating!	addicted to reading books and fairytales
FormID: 00044206	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Someone relit the torch of Arden-Sul. Maybe they'll come here next and save us.	
FormID: 00044207	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Great Torch has been relit. I wonder if that's a good sign, or a bad sign?	
FormID: 00044208	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I hope everyone keeps working and doesn't take the time to go see the Great Torch.	
FormID: 00044209	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Maybe I should get a Great Torch like in New Sheoth. I'll bet it would help keep me awake.	sleepily
FormID: 0004420A	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	So the Great Torch has been lit again. If it doesn't kill Scalons, it doesn't mean much to me.	
FormID: 0004420B	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I heard someone relit the Torch at the Sacellum Arden-Sul. Good news, unless... what if someone is just trying to trick us?	
FormID: 0004420C	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	That torch in New Sheoth is lit. Hopefully, that will burn off some of the airborne germs. It won't get all of them, though.	deathly afraid of germs
FormID: 0004420D	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The burning flame of the Great Torch casts a peaceful glow, but will the flame stay ablaze or will it one day go?	
FormID: 0004420E	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I hear you light that big torch in the city by setting yourself on fire. Now there's an idea. I'd like to see that, but the city is so far away.	
FormID: 0004420F	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	What do I care about a big torch in the city? I'm too busy to worry about the games of city-folk. A giant garden, that'd be something.	
FormID: 00044210	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Great Torch in New Sheoth is lit. Should be easier to count the dead bodies that get dumped on the city street at night now.	
FormID: 00044211	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	2, 3... That big ol' torch in... 4, 5... New Sheoth is finally lit... 7, 8. 	
FormID: 00044212	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I've heard the Great Torch is lit once more. City dwellers. Such useless folk. I've got no use for them. A giant torch? Really?	
FormID: 00044213	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Great Torch, the Great Torch! Why's everyone bothering me about that? I've got a Great Torch for you, right here.	
FormID: 00044214	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	So she says, [QUOTE]Is that a Great Torch in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?[QUOTE] Ha!	
FormID: 00044215	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	There is no Great Torch. And it isn't ablaze once more.	
FormID: 00044216	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	People are all excited about the Great Torch being relit. Personally, I don't pay any attention to politics.	
FormID: 00044217	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Great Torch is lit in the city. Do you hear it? I do.	
FormID: 00044218	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Torch lights the city once again. Fat lot of good it does those of use working out here.	
FormID: 00044219	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Relan understands the Great Torch burns again. Relan thinks this is a good sign.	
FormID: 0004421A	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	So, the Great Torch burns. I know something about burning. The human body makes a pretty good torch, especially the fattier parts.	haughty, arrogant, and cruel
FormID: 0004421B	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Great Torch is burning again! This calls for a celebration! You can spot me, right? Just a few gold?	
FormID: 0004421C	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Some fool lit himself on fire in the city.	
FormID: 0004421D	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Great Torch burns once more -- a beacon of comfort that only serves to mock my existence.	
FormID: 0004421E	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Stay back! Where'd you come from? The big torch in the city? Back away, I say. Back!	
FormID: 0004421F	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Oh, what a pretty colored moth you are! Don't fly into the city. There's a big torch there. Bad news for little moths.	
FormID: 00044220	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Great Torch burns with such vibrant color. I should try and incorporate the hues in my next work.	
FormID: 00044223	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The city isn't ruled by Dukes. It's ruled by elected representatives. And they wear funny hats.	pathologically lying
FormID: 00044224	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	A new ruler for Dementia! This is the stuff epic novels are made of.	addicted to reading books and fairytales
FormID: 00044225	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Power changes hands in Crucible, which means even less stability for the Realm. Just what we needed.	
FormID: 00044226	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	A new ruler in Crucible? It doesn't concern me.	
FormID: 00044227	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	A new ruler in Dementia is no reason to lay about.	
FormID: 00044228	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	A new ruler in Crucible? One more thing to keep me up at night.	sleepily
FormID: 00044229	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The lands of Dementia have a new ruler. Perhaps we'll finally take care of this Scalon problem once and for all.	
FormID: 0004422A	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	So we have a new ruler of Dementia. How do I know this one isn't in league with Them?	
FormID: 0004422B	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Someone has replaced the Duchess!  I bet she got sick and died.	deathly afraid of germs
FormID: 0004422C	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The circle has completed, the Ritual has been done. A new leader sits upon the throne, the royal post is won. 	
FormID: 0004422D	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Running Crucible must take a lot of energy. I'd rather just sit here. No reason to do anything else.	
FormID: 0004422E	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	What do I care of the intrigues of the city? Old Duke, new Duke. I'm too busy to keep track of all that nonsense.	
FormID: 0004422F	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Has the new ruler of Crucible thought about setting up a city morgue? I'd keep track of all the bodies!	
FormID: 00044230	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	12, 13... A new ruler for Crucible... 14, 15.	
FormID: 00044231	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Someone new is running Crucible. Can't say I care.	
FormID: 00044232	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	There's a new Duke in the city? Who cares? Go kiss his ass, for all I care. Go on! Go!	
FormID: 00044233	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	So the new duke turns to him and says, [QUOTE]Wrecked him? Damn near killed him![QUOTE] 	
FormID: 00044234	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Syl isn't dead. She's living on an island nearby.	
FormID: 00044235	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I understand Dementia has a new leader. Not my area of interest, honestly.	
FormID: 00044236	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I heard there's a new ruler in Crucible. Of course, I hear lots of things. Like that! Did you hear that?	
FormID: 00044237	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	With Syl gone, perhaps someone will help us out here.	
FormID: 00044238	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Relan hears there's a new ruler in Crucible. Relan finds this interesting.	
FormID: 00044239	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	A new Duke in Crucible? They're all just bags of meat to me.	haughty, arrogant, and cruel
FormID: 0004423A	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I know we're not part of Dementia, but I think their new Duke still deserves a toast, don't you? You're buying, right?	
FormID: 0004423B	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I bet I'd make a better Duke than the new one.	
FormID: 0004423C	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Like the leaves of a tree, Syl has fallen from Sheogorath's grace and no longer rules Dementia.	
FormID: 0004423D	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Whoa, look at the fangs on you! There's a new ruler in Crucible. Don't bite me!	
FormID: 0004423E	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Horsey! Did you hear about the new ruler in Crucible? Did you? Good horsey.	
FormID: 0004423F	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Duchess of Dementia has been assassinated? Well, no need to finish her portrait then.	
FormID: 0005ED90	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon isn't dead. He's just hiding.	pathologically lying
FormID: 0005ED9E	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon is dead. Quite a tragedy. Perhaps someone will write about it.	addicted to reading books and fairytales
FormID: 0005EDAE	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	A new ruler of Mania. It doesn't sound good to me.	
FormID: 0005EDAF	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	A new ruler in Bliss? It doesn't concern me.	
FormID: 0005EDB0	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I don't expect anyone to be working any less just because of Thadon's death. Take a moment to mourn, then back to work.	
FormID: 0005EDB3	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon is dead? I had a nightmare about that once.	sleepily
FormID: 0005EDB5	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Hmmm... perhaps the new ruler of Mania will take care of the Scalons.	
FormID: 0005EDB9	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Someone new on the throne of Mania? I hope it's not one of Them.	
FormID: 0005EDBA	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Someone has replaced the Duke. I bet he got sick and died.	deathly afraid of germs
FormID: 0005EDBB	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The circle has completed, the Ritual has been done. A new leader sits upon the throne, the royal post is won.

FormID: 0005EDC0	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Someone new is running Bliss. Can't say I care.	
FormID: 0005EDC1	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon's dead? So what? He annoyed me as much as you do.	
FormID: 0005EDC2	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	...and he says, [QUOTE]Eat the Greenmote, drag Thadon. Eat the Greenmote, drag Thadon.[QUOTE] Ha!	
FormID: 0005EDC4	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon's not dead. He lives underground. In a house made of cheese.	
FormID: 0005EDC5	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I understand Mania has a new leader. Not my area of interest, honestly.	
FormID: 0005EDC6	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I heard there's a new ruler in Bliss. Of course, I hear lots of things. Like that! Did you hear that?	
FormID: 0005EDCB	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	With Thadon gone, perhaps someone will help us out here.	
FormID: 0005EDF0	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Relan hears there's a new ruler in Bliss. Relan finds this interesting.	
FormID: 0005EDF1	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Thadon's dead? They're all just bags of meat to me.	haughty, arrogant, and cruel
FormID: 0005EDF2	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Not every day we get a new Duke! Let's celebrate, you and me! Whaddya say you buy the first round?	
FormID: 0005EDF3	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I bet I'd make a better Duke than the new one.	
FormID: 0005EDF9	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Like the leaves of a tree, Thadon has fallen from Sheogorath's grace and no longer rules Mania.	
FormID: 0005EDFA	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Whoa, look at the fangs on you! There's a new ruler in Bliss. Don't bite me!	
FormID: 0005EDFB	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Horsey! Did you hear about the new ruler in Bliss? Did you? Good horsey.

FormID: 0005EF6F	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Knights of Order are here to protect us.	pathologically lying
FormID: 0005EF70	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Knights of Order? These aren't the valiant knights from the epic tales!	addicted to reading books and fairytales
FormID: 0005EF71	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I've always known we're not truly safe in the Isles. Perhaps now more people will listen.	
FormID: 0005EF72	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I'm not saying I like the idea of these Knights and all, but the Shivering Isles could really use a dose of Order.	
FormID: 0005EF73	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Attacks in Passwall? Invaders roaming the lands? You see, this is what happens when leadership is lax.	
FormID: 0005EF76	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	It's worse than my nightmares! In fact, it's like my worst nightmares come true!	sleepily
FormID: 0005EF82	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Fringe can fend for itself. We have our own problems.	
FormID: 0005EF83	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	They're coming for me. Those Knights. I should have seen it coming.	
FormID: 0005EF84	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Those strange Knights probably have diseases from wherever they came from. Best stay away from them.	deathly afraid of germs
FormID: 0005EF8C	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Knights have returned with a vengeance, their blades stained with blood. Who will be able to stop them, to stem this deadly flood?	
FormID: 0005EF8D	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Life might be easier if Order wipes everything out. Everything would be grey and plain. Like my life.	
FormID: 0005EF9C	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I hope those Knights of Order stay away from my garden. I'd hate to have to start all over again.	
FormID: 0005EF9F	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I've never counted a Knight of Order corpse. I wonder what they look like.	
FormID: 0005EFA1	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	1, 2... sad about Passwall. 3, 4... I wonder if they will rebuild it. ...5, 6.	
FormID: 0005EFA6	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Damn Knights! Scaring away all the beasts!	
FormID: 0005EFA7	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I wish those Knights of Order would come here and wipe everyone out. I'd finally get some piece and quiet!	
FormID: 0005EFA8	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Why did the Knights of Order cross the Fringe? No one knows.	
FormID: 0005EFAA	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	These invaders that everyone is afraid of don't even exist. I swear, why would someone start a rumor to create panic?	
FormID: 0005EFB6	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	All my work on the Fringe... wasted. I'll have to begin my research all over again.	
FormID: 0005EFBD	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	If the old Gatekeeper were still around, those Knights wouldn't have caused such trouble.	
FormID: 0005EFC1	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Invaders? You don't... you don't suppose that they've come for ME do you?	
FormID: 0005EFE5	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Visit Passwall once, Relan did. Good that it burned. People there deserve pain.	
FormID: 0005EFFB	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	With the Gatekeeper gone, the Knights of Order have been causing trouble in the Fringe.	haughty, arrogant, and cruel
FormID: 0005EFFC	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Fringe was destroyed! Did you hear? Gone. Everything turned to dust! You don't think that could happen here, do you?	
FormID: 0005EFFD	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Those Knights of Order are always causing trouble. Don't worry, though. I'll figure out what to do.	
FormID: 0005EFFE	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The day has finally arrived, a day of doom and despair. Whatever shall we do?	
FormID: 0005F022	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Don't eat me! You're worse than those knights in the Fringe!	
FormID: 0005F023	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Those creatures in the Fringe are scary. Not like you, you fuzzy little rascal!	
FormID: 0005F02A	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I must make my way to The Fringe and capture its destruction on canvas. We can't let history be forgotten.	
FormID: 0005F210	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper is still dead. That's fine. He never did anything useful, anyway.	pathologically lying
FormID: 0005F212	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper will keep out those adventurers again. Too bad. Some of them had exciting stories to tell.	addicted to reading books and fairytales
FormID: 0005F218	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper walks once more, but what good does that do me? Who knows what's already inside the Realm.	
FormID: 0005F219	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Have you seen the new Gatekeeper? I hear they built him with four arms and no head! Or was it four heads and no arms?	
FormID: 0005F21A	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I have to admit that when he's not dead, the Gatekeeper seems to do an excellent job. Perhaps Relan could learn from it.	
FormID: 0005F21C	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The new Gatekeeper will keep more adventurers in the Fringe. More business for my inn.	sleepily
FormID: 0005F21D	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	They can build a new Gatekeeper, but they can't send someone to aid me in fighting these Scalons?	
FormID: 0005F21E	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I hear there's a new Gatekeeper. What if They tamper with him, and send him after me?	
FormID: 0005F21F	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	There's a new Gatekeeper. I hope this one doesn't get sick and die like the first one.	deathly afraid of germs
FormID: 0005F220	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Stronger than ever, and ever before. The new Gatekeeper is the ultimate ward.	
FormID: 0005F221	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	They made a new Gatekeeper. I'd go see him, but that would take effort.	
FormID: 0005F222	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I'm glad the Gatekeeper is back. Lets me focus on my work.	
FormID: 0005F223	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	There's probably a growing pile of bodies near that new Gatekeeper. I should go count them.	
FormID: 0005F224	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	7, 8... There's a new Gatekeeper in the Fringe. 9, 10.	
FormID: 0005F225	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	A new Gatekeeper is in the Fringe now. That's good. Fewer adventurers means more creatures for me to hunt.	
FormID: 0005F226	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	When you're done boring me, why don't you go have a chat with the new Gatekeeper? Run along now!	
FormID: 0005F227	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	So then Sorceress says to the new Gatekeeper, [QUOTE]But in the morning, you'll still be ugly![QUOTE]	
FormID: 0005F228	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Did you hear? I helped rebuild the Gatekeeper! He has my eyes.... What? I got new ones!	
FormID: 0005F22A	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I'd be very interested in taking a look at this new Gatekeeper. An entirely new form of life!	
FormID: 0005F22B	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I wish I'd been able to help construct the new Gatekeeper.	
FormID: 0005F22C	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Now that the Gatekeeper lives again, I have to ask... is he there to keep others out, or to keep us in? Think about it.	
FormID: 0005F22D	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Relan is jealous of the Gatekeeper. Relan wishes that he had swords for arms.	
FormID: 0005F231	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	My new Gatekeeper is a miracle. He's perfect.	
FormID: 0005F232	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	What do you say we drink a toast to the new Gatekeeper together? Hey, could you spot me, just this once?	
FormID: 0005F234	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The rebuilt the Gatekeeper. I thought they should have done that a long time ago.	
FormID: 0005F235	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Why build the Gatekeeper again, if he will one day fall? Seems so sad and pointless.	
FormID: 0005F236	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	You're more fearsome than the new Gatekeeper. Look at the teeth on you!	
FormID: 0005F237	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	They built a new Gatekeeper! Yes they did. Yes they did. Aren't you just precious?	
FormID: 0005F238	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Gatekeeper's return can only mean one thing... time to begin a new painting of him.	
FormID: 0005F431	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Those aren't Sheogorath's real armies that have returned. The real ones are being held in a secret underground compound.	pathologically lying
FormID: 0005F432	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Read your histories: a strong army guarantees a strong Realm. Good thing Sheogorath's armies are back to full strength.	addicted to reading books and fairytales
FormID: 0005F451	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	What do I care of armies that I never see? They don't ever set foot here, do they? We have to protect ourselves.	
FormID: 0005F452	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The new Duke is really taking charge of things. Maybe there is hope for the Realm.	
FormID: 0005F453	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	So, the armies have been restored. They'd better not show up here looking to procure my crops.	
FormID: 0005F45D	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The armies have returned. Thank the Madgod! I've had nightmares about them disappearing.	sleepily
FormID: 0005F45E	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	A whole army restored, and still these Scalons run free. Must I do everything myself?	
FormID: 0005F45F	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Armies are well and good, but only if you know who you're fighting.	
FormID: 0005F460	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The armies of Sheogorath have returned? Putting lots of people in the same place is known to spread disease. I hope they keep the barracks far away.	deathly afraid of germs
FormID: 0005F461	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Madgod's army has returned, their weapons primed to slay. Could this mean our downfall, or will we win the day?	
FormID: 0005F462	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	So we have armies again? I wouldn't want to be in an army. All that physical exertion. Better to just sit and regain your strength.	
FormID: 0005F463	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath's army is restored? That's good. You learn discipline in the army, something folks around here are lacking.	
FormID: 0005F471	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Do you suppose the armies will start killing people now? I'd keep an accurate count of all the corpses.	
FormID: 0005F476	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	1, 2... Sheogorath's got his army... 3, 4... in the barracks... 5, 6.	
FormID: 0005F47E	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The armies are back in order? I've got no use for armies. Killing is personal, not political.	
FormID: 0005F481	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I hear the army is restored. You should go see if they need a target dummy to practice on.	
FormID: 0005F494	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Do you know where Sheogorath keeps his armies? In his sleevies! Ah hahaha!	
FormID: 0005F4A3	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I hear that my army has been restored. Perhaps I should join up again....	
FormID: 0005F4AF	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The tedious to-ings and fro-ings of the armies of Sheogorath are of no interest to me.	
FormID: 0005F4B2	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Armies with steel are good, but armies can be destroyed. Magic is better. Magic can bring armies back to life.	
FormID: 0005F4C5	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	People keep telling me that the armies of Sheogorath are reassembled... as if this is something that we should be happy about.	
FormID: 0005F4C6	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Armies? Pah! Armies are worthless. Killing is best by one man alone. In the dark. Sneak. Sneak. Then blood.	
FormID: 0005F4C7	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The power of Sheogorath doesn't lie in armies. Power comes from the willingness to do things others won't.	haughty, arrogant, and cruel
FormID: 0005F4E2	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	They SAY the armies have been restored. But you think that's the whole story? Not by half, just you wait and see.	
FormID: 0005F52A	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The armies are back together now, I hear. I'd never have let them get lost in the first place.	
FormID: 0005F535	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Armies can only mean one thing... more sorrow and more death.	
FormID: 0005F55E	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Leave me alone. Sheogorath's armies are coming. You better run away!	
FormID: 0005F55F	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The armies are restored, you say? My, what a smart little thing you are!	
FormID: 0005F560	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Now there's an army to protect us? Ugh, and I almost had begun to paint [QUOTE]The Gatekeeper in Repose.[QUOTE] Oh well, time to start again.	
FormID: 00060528	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I know where Sheogorath is. He's hiding in my house. In a cupboard. But he's invisible.	pathologically lying
FormID: 00060529	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath has left. Where did he go? It's a mystery! I love mystery stories. I wonder how this one will end.	addicted to reading books and fairytales
FormID: 0006052A	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The whole Realm is at risk. Finally everyone can understand what it's like living under a blanket of fear.	
FormID: 0006052B	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	We're doomed. The Greymarch can't be stopped. We'll all be Ordered like the old tales tell.	
FormID: 0006052C	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Just like Sheogorath to abandon us in our time of need. He has been ever fickle.	
FormID: 0006052D	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath has disappeared. This is worse than my nightmares.	sleepily
FormID: 0006052E	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Perhaps I was wrong. Maybe the Scalons aren't the worst thing that could happen to us. I mean... Sheogorath himself has vanished.	
FormID: 0006052F	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I'm telling you, They're behind all of this. All of it! No one is going to listen to me until it's too late!	
FormID: 00060531	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Where did Sheogorath go? Great. I bet he got sick and died. We're all going to die now!	deathly afraid of germs
FormID: 00060534	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Mad One has vanished from the Isles, fear sits heavy on the brow. All our hopes go with one, but can he save us now? 	
FormID: 00060535	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath's gone. I wish I could just disappear that way. Sometimes I feel invisible. But, that's not the same. I need a nap.	
FormID: 00060536	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I guess even our Lord Sheogorath needs to take a vacation once in a while. Not me, though. I'm happy to keep working.	
FormID: 00060537	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Do you think Sheogorath died? I know He's missing. I want to see His corpse if He's dead.	
FormID: 00060538	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	5, 4... Sheogorath has left us alone in this terrible time. 3, 2, 1.	
FormID: 00060539	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Even the great Lord Sheogorath forsakes us. The bones are getting louder.	
FormID: 0006053A	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Maybe you're the reason Sheogorath left. Probably are. You make me want to leave whenever I see you.	
FormID: 0006053B	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Knock, knock. Who's there? Not Sheogorath.	
FormID: 0006053E	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I know where Sheogorath has gone! Of course, I'm not going to tell you.	
FormID: 00060563	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	People act like Sheogorath's disappearance is of some grave significance. But the Shivering Isles are the same as ever, I assure you.	
FormID: 000605E6	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Where has our Lord gone? I hope He returns soon.	
FormID: 000605E9	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath has vanished? Another already seeks his throne. One tyrant passes and another rises. To the void with them.	
FormID: 000605EA	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The Madgod is gone. Can he die? 	
FormID: 000605EB	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Our Lord is too scared to face the Greymarch, is he? Coward! Good riddance.	haughty, arrogant, and cruel
FormID: 000605EC	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath gone. The Duke gone. This whole thing is making me really, really nervous. I need to calm down.	
FormID: 000605ED	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath leaves in the middle of the Greymarch. Perhaps I should take over ruling the Realm.	
FormID: 000605F1	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Oh! Our Lord has abandoned us! What will be our fate?	
FormID: 000605F3	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I wish I could vanish like Sheogorath, right about now. Please don't hurt me.	
FormID: 000605F5	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Have you come to cheer me up? I'm worried about Lord Sheogorath. Are you worried, you little darling? 	
FormID: 000605F6	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Sheogorath has disappeared! How can I be expected to paint at a time like this?	
FormID: 000607E5	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	We're all doomed. Jyggalag has won. Sheogorath is dead. The forces of Order are victorious.	pathologically lying
FormID: 000607E6	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	We're all still here. It's a miracle! Someone really needs to write a book about this. Perhaps I should....	addicted to reading books and fairytales
FormID: 000607E7	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The world didn't end. Today, at least. That doesn't mean we're safe tomorrow. Doesn't really mean we're safe now, either.	
FormID: 000607E8	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	It's... unbelievable. Order was defeated? All the old tales say that's impossible.	
FormID: 000607E9	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I'm glad that this war business is over and done with. There are those of us who have work to do.	
FormID: 000607EB	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	The forces Order have been defeated. Perhaps now I can sleep.	sleepily
FormID: 000607EF	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Fine, fine. So the Realm still stands. That doesn't mean there are any fewer Scalons in the Isles.	
FormID: 000607F2	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	It seems They have been thwarted for now. I know They're still plotting against me, though. It's only a matter of time.	
FormID: 000607F4	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Jyggalag is gone, but I bet he brought a ton of diseases with him. We still aren't safe.	deathly afraid of germs
FormID: 000607F5	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Now the day has ended, the battle has been won. A new day dawns on the Isles, the past has been undone.	
FormID: 000607F6	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I suppose I should be glad the world didn't end. But, in some ways, I wish it had. It would be easier than... this.	
FormID: 000607FB	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	That was close, but Sheogorath has won. I'd better get back to work.	
FormID: 000607FE	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I wonder how many corpses line the palace grounds. Perhaps I should count them.	
FormID: 000607FF	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	1, 2...  the Greymarch is over. 4, 5... Thank Sheogorath... 6, 7.	
FormID: 00060800	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I'm glad Jyggalag is defeated. Can't imagine a grey world. 	
FormID: 00060801	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	I suppose you think we should celebrate Jyggalag's defeat? The enemy of my enemy and all that? You're wrong.	
FormID: 00060802	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	What do you call the time between one victory dance and another? The Jig-lag! Get it?	
FormID: 00060824	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Behold the new god of madness! It is I, Kishashi, who has defeated the forces of Jyggalag!	
FormID: 00060861	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	With the Greymarch ended, I need to devote some serious study to the obelisks. They have proven more interesting than I had thought.	
FormID: 00060887	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Jyggalag's forces have been defeated. Perhaps Order is simply an inferior element.	
FormID: 000608B6	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Don't think for a second that this war is actually over. Stay on your guard. The agents of the enemy lurk everywhere.	
FormID: 000608E3	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Much blood has come and gone. Relan is sad. Relan was stuck in Fellmoor for all the war... no blood... no war... poor Relan.	
FormID: 00060901	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Maybe now that Jyggalag is gone, Sheogorath will finally return my affections.	haughty, arrogant, and cruel
FormID: 0006090B	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Victory calls for celebration, don't you think? I wish I had the coin to drink a toast to Sheogorath.	
FormID: 00060918	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Jyggalag's defeated. Took them long enough to get rid of him.	
FormID: 0006091A	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	What's the point in being happy that the Greymarch has ended? Tomorrow something new will arise to destroy us.	
FormID: 0006091B	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	It seems the world is safe again... unless you're going to eat me. You're not going to eat me, are you? Are you? Please don't!	
FormID: 0006094E	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Look at you wag your tail! You're happy Jyggalag is gone too, aren't you? Yes you are! Yes you are!	
FormID: 0006094F	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Finally, some peace and quiet around here... now I can get some serious work done.	
FormID: 0004109E	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Did you really have some important reason for interrupting me? I thought not.	
FormID: 0004109F	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	How many times have I told you to leave me alone?	
FormID: 000410A0	SENQDWilderness	INFOGENERAL	0	Cretin! Nincompoop! Halfwit! Now I have to start all over again. Happy?	
FormID: 00028A28	EmfridDEMO	GOODBYE	0	Goodbye. And thank you.	
FormID: 00028A29	EmfridDEMO	GOODBYE	0	Come back when you've learned something.	
FormID: 0002C2EF	Charactergen	GOODBYE	0	Stick close and let us do our job, and you'll be all right.	
FormID: 0005144A	Charactergen	GOODBYE	0	She's dead. I'm sorry, sire, but we have to keep moving.	
FormID: 00038FCB	MQ10	GOODBYE	0	You should rendezvous with Captain Burd immediately. The sooner that gate is closed the better.	
FormID: 000146EF	MQ16	GOODBYE	0	As you command, sire. Guards! Form up and protect the Emperor! To the Temple of the One!	
FormID: 00049814	MQ16	GOODBYE	0	Very well. Let's finish this.	
FormID: 000A7130	MQ16	GOODBYE	0	Let's continue on to the Elder Council Chambers.	
FormID: 00036418	MQConversations	GOODBYE	0	The time of Preparation is almost over.	
FormID: 00036419	MQConversations	GOODBYE	0	The time of Cleansing is at hand, praise be.	
FormID: 000463D4	MQConversations	GOODBYE	0	Believe me, it was no picnic. But thanks to our friend here, I now know we can close these hell-gates. We can defend Bruma!	emphasis on _can_ in both sentences
FormID: 00088B3B	MQConversations	GOODBYE	0	It won't matter. Lord Dagon will soon be able to cross over. The Master's plan will have succeeded.	
FormID: 00088B3C	MQConversations	GOODBYE	0	At least Anaxes isn't here to torment us anymore.	REC: wearily, but with a small tinge of relief [QUOTE]Things still totally suck, but ...[QUOTE][CRLF]
FormID: 00088B40	MQConversations	GOODBYE	0	Watch out for Anaxes. Some meddling fool must have let him loose.	REC: ann-AXE-eez[CRLF]Fearfully, and angrily
FormID: 00088B41	MQConversations	GOODBYE	0	Nothing really matters here anyway.	REC: very wearily, hopelessly
FormID: 00088B43	MQConversations	GOODBYE	0	I keep hoping that I won't wake up the next time they kill me. But I always do. We will never escape this nightmare.	REC: with extreme hopelessness, weariness
FormID: 00088B44	MQConversations	GOODBYE	0	Some of the new ones say that the war is going badly. The attack on Bruma failed completely.	
FormID: 00088B47	MQConversations	GOODBYE	0	I don't believe we'll escape here even if Dagon's invasion succeeds. We'll be the Master's playthings forever.	
FormID: 00088B65	MQConversations	GOODBYE	0	Be patient. Lord Dagon's victory is only a matter of time now, and then we will return to Tamriel in triumph.	REC: DAY-gon
FormID: 00088B66	MQConversations	GOODBYE	0	Those who despair will certainly never be permitted to leave the Eternal Garden.	
FormID: 00088B67	MQConversations	GOODBYE	0	The Eternal Garden is the testing ground for the new rulers of Tamriel. I intend to pass the Master's test.	
FormID: 00088B68	MQConversations	GOODBYE	0	We'll speak again soon, no doubt.	
FormID: 000477FA	MQ15	GOODBYE	0	The Master will soon deal with you.	Fanatical
FormID: 00088B3A	MQ15	GOODBYE	0	Leave me in peace.	REC: hopelessly, weary to the bone
FormID: 00036006	MQ13	GOODBYE	0	As you command, Countess.	
FormID: 00038FBE	MQ12	GOODBYE	0	Be careful, my friend. I know you have braved many dangers already, but Miscarcand is not to be taken lightly.	
FormID: 00038FCA	MQ12	GOODBYE	0	I should have the final part of the ritual deciphered soon. It's only a matter of time now.	
FormID: 00038FC1	MQ08	GOODBYE	0	I think I'm close to deciphering more of the ritual. I hope to have made some progress by the time you return with a daedric artifact.	
FormID: 00038FCC	MQ08	GOODBYE	0	I'm still working on the second item needed for the gate-opening ritual. I believe I'm close to deciphering the relevant passage.	
FormID: 00038BBF	MQ07	GOODBYE	0	I will send word to the Countess at once of the danger to Bruma. You should speak to Martin about his progress with the Xarxes.	
FormID: 00038BC0	MQ07	GOODBYE	0	The plans you found make it clear that the Mythic Dawn will soon move against us here. You must eliminate their agents in Bruma.	
FormID: 00038BC1	MQ07	GOODBYE	0	I'm counting on you to eliminate those spies. We can't afford to let the Mythic Dawn operate out of Bruma with impunity.	
FormID: 00038BC2	MQ07	GOODBYE	0	Let me know when you have found and eliminated the Mythic Dawn agents in Bruma.	
FormID: 00038BC3	MQ07	GOODBYE	0	I hope to have at least part of the Mysterium Xarxes translated in a few days. Speak to Jauffre about those spies in the meantime.	
FormID: 00038BC4	MQ07	GOODBYE	0	I'm working as quickly I can. The Xarxes doesn't give up its secrets easily.	
FormID: 0003664C	MQ06	GOODBYE	0	Go and prepare yourself. The Master will have need of all of us soon.	
FormID: 00034245	MQ05	GOODBYE	0	I hope you learn something from Tar-Meena about that book. This might just be the break we need.	
FormID: 00034246	MQ05	GOODBYE	0	It sounds like those books may be an important lead. Get back to me as soon as you turn up anything new.	
FormID: 00095890	MQ05	GOODBYE	0	Follow me. I know how to get to the part of the sewers where we need to meet the Sponsor.	
FormID: 000A31BA	MQ05	GOODBYE	0	Make it quick. The longer we spend down here, the more chance we have of being discovered.	
FormID: 00065556	MQ05	GOODBYE	0	I'll see you back at Cloud Ruler Temple. Good luck.	
FormID: 000343EB	MQ05	GOODBYE	0	It was so nice chatting with you. Be sure to let me know how your hunt for the Mythic Dawn turns out.	
FormID: 000343EC	MQ05	GOODBYE	0	I'll keep studying the first two volumes of the [QUOTE]Commentaries.[QUOTE] Who knows, I might turn up something before you do!	
FormID: 000343ED	MQ05	GOODBYE	0	The first words of each paragraph are the key, I'm sure of it! Well, I shouldn't keep you. Goodbye.	
FormID: 000343EE	MQ05	GOODBYE	0	I've half a mind to go down to Green Emperor Way myself and see what's there ... Well, good luck! I hope you find what you're looking for.	
FormID: 000343F4	MQ05	GOODBYE	0	Give my warm regards to Baurus. Tell him he should not blame himself for the Emperor's death. He did well to send you to me.	
FormID: 000343F6	MQ05	GOODBYE	0	Don't worry about me, my friend. I know I'm in good hands here.	
FormID: 00037B4F	MQ04	GOODBYE	0	Yes, Cyrus. This is the Emperor's son, Martin Septim.	
FormID: 000343E8	MQ04	GOODBYE	0	Be careful. There may be more of them about.	
FormID: 000343E9	MQ04	GOODBYE	0	We should get moving. I won't rest easy until Martin is safe at Cloud Ruler Temple.	
FormID: 00090992	MQ04	GOODBYE	0	We'd better find Jauffre.	
FormID: 00090993	MQ04	GOODBYE	0	Be careful.	
FormID: 000343E6	MQ03	GOODBYE	0	Waste no time. You must find Martin before the enemy does.	
FormID: 000366E3	MQ03	GOODBYE	0	Come back with help. I don't know how much longer we can hold out in here.	
FormID: 00038FC3	MQ09	GOODBYE	0	Be sure to speak to Jauffre about the Armor of Tiber Septim. I'll continue my study of the Mysterium Xarxes.	
FormID: 00038FC4	MQ09	GOODBYE	0	Good luck, my friend. Don't take any unnecessary risks.	
FormID: 00038FBF	MQ11	GOODBYE	0	You should speak to the rulers of Cyrodiil as soon as possible. The danger to Bruma is growing by the day.	
FormID: 0018D7E0	BladesConvSystem	GOODBYE	0	Keep your heart true... and your eyes open.	
FormID: 0018D7E1	BladesConvSystem	GOODBYE	0	May Uriel's spirit guide us in these troubled times.

FormID: 00067DBE	BladesMartinConvSystem	GOODBYE	0	Thank you again for your kind words. Now please, don't let me keep you. We'll speak again later.  	
FormID: 00068343	BladesMartinConvSystem	GOODBYE	0	Just remember, we're in this together. You must learn to rely on me as I rely on you. But I've rambled on long enough. Akatosh be with you.	
FormID: 00068344	BladesMartinConvSystem	GOODBYE	0	My heart is lighter thanks to your words. You've given me kinship, and that is worth more than a thousand swords. Until later, friend.	
FormID: 000688FB	BladesMartinConvSystem	GOODBYE	0	I offer no excuses, sire. But my life is yours. No assassin will take you while I draw breath.	
FormID: 000688FC	BladesMartinConvSystem	GOODBYE	0	Don't let me keep you.

FormID: 00068345	BladesMartinConvSystem	GOODBYE	0	I thank you again for speaking with me, my lord. I'll leave you alone now. I know you're very busy. Until next time.	
FormID: 00067DC7	BladesMartinConvSystem	GOODBYE	0	Well, I've kept you long enough, my lord. Remember that I'm here if you need anything.	
FormID: 00068346	BladesMartinConvSystem	GOODBYE	0	I'm sorry, sir, I've been rambling on like an excitable child! I can only imagine how busy you must be. With your blessing, I will now take my leave.	
FormID: 00068906	BladesMartinConvSystem	GOODBYE	0	I'm at your service, my lord.	
FormID: 000366E2	MQ00	GOODBYE	0	I have many questions about all this. I hope Jauffre will be able to answer them.

FormID: 00026EA7	MQ10	GREETING	0	I've just received word from the Countess of Bruma that an Oblivion Gate has opened outside the city.	
FormID: 00026EA7	MQ10	GREETING	1	It seems that the Mythic Dawn are putting their plan to attack Bruma into motion.	
FormID: 00026EA7	MQ10	GREETING	2	Since you've dealt with these Gates before, I'd like you to help the Countess's guard close this gate.	
FormID: 00026EA7	MQ10	GREETING	3	Once they've seen how it's done, they should be able to handle any new gates on their own.	
FormID: 00026EA8	MQ10	GREETING	0	Good work. Captain Burd and his guardsmen should be able to handle any additional Gates, at least for now.	
FormID: 00026EA8	MQ10	GREETING	1	But the Bruma Guard cannot defend the city indefinitely. The daedra of Oblivion are innumerable; the guardsmen of Bruma are not.	
FormID: 00026EA8	MQ10	GREETING	2	We need to gather what allies we can before Bruma is hopelessly besieged.	
FormID: 00026EA8	MQ10	GREETING	3	If the Mythic Dawn manages to open a Great Gate here, the city will need a stronger garrison for there to be any hope of defending it.	
FormID: 00026EA8	MQ10	GREETING	4	You should speak to the rulers of the other cities of Cyrodiil, as well as the Elder Council. Ask them to send aid to Bruma before it is too late.	
FormID: 00027120	MQ10	GREETING	0	Don't forget, Captain Burd needs your help to close the Oblivion Gate outside of Bruma.	
FormID: 00026EE9	MQ10	GREETING	0	Thanks for coming. Since we had the Hero of Kvatch available, I didn't think it made sense to try this on our own the first time.	
FormID: 00026EE9	MQ10	GREETING	1	We're ready when you are. Just say the word and we'll follow you into that hell-spawned Gate.	
FormID: 0003A844	MQ10	GREETING	0	We're ready when you are.	
FormID: 0003A845	MQ10	GREETING	0	Let's make these bastards sorry they messed with Bruma.	
FormID: 00026EEB	MQ10	GREETING	0	It was an honor to serve with you, ma'am. Now that I've seen how it's done, I think my guardsmen and I can handle any new Gates that open near Bruma.	
FormID: 00026EEC	MQ10	GREETING	0	It was an honor to serve with you, sir. Now that I've seen how it's done, I think my guardsmen and I can handle any new Gates that open near Bruma.	
FormID: 00026EED	MQ10	GREETING	0	Thanks for your help closing that Gate. Don't worry, we can handle anything else they throw at us.	
FormID: 00046308	MQ10	GREETING	0	This is no place I ever wanted to find myself. I don't see how we can ...

FormID: 00046308	MQ10	GREETING	2	I'm glad you're here. We wouldn't have a chance otherwise. What's our next move?	
FormID: 00026EEE	MQ10	GREETING	0	What's the plan, sir?	
FormID: 00026EEF	MQ10	GREETING	0	What's the plan, ma'am?	
FormID: 0003A846	MQ10	GREETING	0	Do we really have to go into that thing?	
FormID: 0003A847	MQ10	GREETING	0	I don't think we're going to make it out of here alive.	
FormID: 0003A848	MQ10	GREETING	0	The Captain's in charge. I'll follow his orders.

FormID: 0003D7ED	MQ14	GREETING	0	We won a great victory here today! We now have the means to recover the Amulet of Kings from Mankar Camoran.	
FormID: 0003D7ED	MQ14	GREETING	1	But we need to act quickly. Camoran will not take long to recognize his danger.	
FormID: 0003D7ED	MQ14	GREETING	2	Remember, the portal closes behind you. Anything you need, carry it with you.	
FormID: 0003D7ED	MQ14	GREETING	3	I'll have the ritual ready in the Great Hall when you arrive. Farewell.	
FormID: 0003C139	MQ14	GREETING	0	You should be proud of what you did here today, but remember, the war is not yet over.	
FormID: 0003C139	MQ14	GREETING	1	Until you reclaim the Amulet and Martin lights the Dragonfires, the enemy will not be truly defeated.	
FormID: 000152ED	MQ16	GREETING	0	We're too late... Mehrunes Dagon is here!	
FormID: 000152ED	MQ16	GREETING	1	Lighting the Dragonfires will no longer save us... the barriers that protected us from Oblivion are gone...	
FormID: 0008E11F	MQ16	GREETING	0	I do what I must do. I cannot stay to rebuild Tamriel. That task falls to others.	
FormID: 0008E11F	MQ16	GREETING	1	Farewell. You've been a good friend, in the short time that I've known you.	
FormID: 0008E11F	MQ16	GREETING	2	But now I must go. The Dragon waits.	
FormID: 0008E120	MQ16	GREETING	0	Come on! We need to get to the Dragonfires before it's too late!	
FormID: 0008E121	MQ16	GREETING	0	Help me get past Dagon and into the Temple of the One! I'll do the rest!	
FormID: 000152F1	MQ16	GREETING	0	What should we do now?	
FormID: 00037828	MQ16	GREETING	0	We should go to the Imperial City at once. Lead on.	
FormID: 00037829	MQ16	GREETING	0	What is it?	
FormID: 0004D16C	MQ16	GREETING	0	By ancient tradition, I may not present myself as a candidate for the throne. I need you to formally present my claim to Chancellor Ocato.	
FormID: 0003782A	MQ16	GREETING	0	Let's continue on to the Elder Council Chambers. Delay is dangerous.	
FormID: 0004D0A8	MQ16	GREETING	0	Mehrunes Dagon knows that if I can reach the Temple of the One and light the Dragonfires, he has lost. Come on!	
FormID: 0004D0A9	MQ16	GREETING	0	Come on! We have to protect Martin until he can light the Dragonfires in the Temple!	REC: Urgently -- this is to the player, but in the midst of a huge battle
FormID: 0004D0AA	MQ16	GREETING	0	Good to see you again. I told Martin that Mankar Camoran was no match for you.	
FormID: 0004D0AB	MQ16	GREETING	0	Good to see you again, sir. Martin was worried, but I knew you would bring back the Amulet of Kings for him.	
FormID: 0004D0AC	MQ16	GREETING	0	Good to see you again, ma'am. Martin was worried, but I knew you would bring back the Amulet of Kings for him.	
FormID: 0004BF9A	MQ16	GREETING	0	Time is pressing. Martin must relight the Dragonfires before the enemy can stop us.	
FormID: 0004BF9B	MQ16	GREETING	0	We have to get Martin to the Temple of the One or Mehrunes Dagon has won after all.	
FormID: 0004BF9C	MQ16	GREETING	0	I hope Martin knows what to do now. I will die by his side, if this is the end.	
FormID: 000146ED	MQ16	GREETING	0	I have been expecting you. The full Council has already considered the matter of Martin's claim to the Imperial Throne in detail.	
FormID: 0004D0AD	MQ16	GREETING	0	Where is Martin? I was told that he had arrived in the capital.	
FormID: 0004D0AE	MQ16	GREETING	0	I never thought it would come to this... the Amulet... Martin must use it against Him! We have no choice!	
FormID: 0004D0AF	MQ16	GREETING	0	I am at the Emperor Martin's command.	
FormID: 000473C2	MQ15	GREETING	0	You did not expect to see me again, did you? You have no grasp of the power that my father has at his command.	
FormID: 000473C2	MQ15	GREETING	1	You think you can stop us? Soon Mehrunes Dagon will walk upon Tamriel for the first time since the Mythic Age, and our victory will be complete.	
FormID: 000473C2	MQ15	GREETING	2	Come, my father is waiting to welcome you to Carac Agaialor.	
FormID: 000473C3	MQ15	GREETING	0	Why do you delay? Do you fear to face Mankar Camoran himself? As well you should.

FormID: 000473C4	MQ15	GREETING	0	So here you are at last. The lackey of the Septim pretender. You still think you have a chance, don't you?	
FormID: 000473C4	MQ15	GREETING	1	We knew you would find your way here eventually. But it is of no consequence.	
FormID: 000473C4	MQ15	GREETING	2	You should not keep my father waiting any longer. He expected you hours ago. Come, you came here to see him, did you not?	
FormID: 000473C5	MQ15	GREETING	0	I have nothing else to say to you. But my father wants to speak with you before we send you on your way.	
FormID: 00047226	MQ15	GREETING	0	You made it. I didn't think you'd have any trouble. Let's get these Bands off you ...	
FormID: 00047226	MQ15	GREETING	1	... there. You're not a prisoner of the Forbidden Grotto any longer.	
FormID: 00047226	MQ15	GREETING	2	Let me come with you. Let me help you kill Mankar Camoran. I am not without power.	
FormID: 00015746	MQ15	GREETING	0	You wear the Bands, but you're no prisoner. Who are you? What are you doing here?

FormID: 00027E38	MQ15	GREETING	1	I don't know what you'll find in Camoran's Paradise.	
FormID: 00027E38	MQ15	GREETING	2	I do know the portal I create through the Mysterium Xarxes ritual will close behind you. You'll have to find another way back.	
FormID: 00027E38	MQ15	GREETING	3	I believe that Mankar Camoran acts as the [QUOTE]anchor[QUOTE] for Paradise, just as a sigil stone anchors an Oblivion Gate in place.	
FormID: 00027E38	MQ15	GREETING	4	Kill Mankar Camoran, and you will unmake his Paradise.	
FormID: 00027E38	MQ15	GREETING	5	Shall I open the portal to Paradise? Are you ready?	
FormID: 00027E39	MQ15	GREETING	0	Do you need something? Otherwise I should make my preparations for the ritual. There's no time to lose.	
FormID: 0003782B	MQ15	GREETING	0	You found a way back! Does this mean... ?	
FormID: 000685A4	MQ15	GREETING	0	You must enter the portal to Camoran's Paradise and reclaim the Amulet of Kings!	
FormID: 0003C13B	MQ15	GREETING	0	Once you're rested and equipped, you should have Martin open the portal to Camoran's Paradise immediately.	
FormID: 0003C13B	MQ15	GREETING	1	Don't give the enemy a chance to recover from their defeat.	
FormID: 00037832	MQ15	GREETING	0	You've done it! Victory is within our grasp! Give the Amulet to Martin at once!

FormID: 0003C944	MQ15	GREETING	1	In return for your service, I will give you the key to the Forbidden Grotto, if you still wish it.

FormID: 00047355	MQ15	GREETING	0	You ... how can you be here?	
FormID: 00047355	MQ15	GREETING	1	No matter. You are too late to stop Lord Dagon's victory. Soon we will return to Tamriel, to rule over it as lords.

FormID: 0008B0AC	MQ15	GREETING	0	You came for the Amulet. Take it then!	
FormID: 00092265	MQ03	GREETING	0	Have you brought help? We've been trapped here since the daedra overran the city.	
FormID: 00092266	MQ03	GREETING	0	It isn't that I don't believe you. But I won't go with you until I know everyone can leave here safely.	
FormID: 00092266	MQ03	GREETING	1	We've been through too much together already for me to just abandon them to their fate.	
FormID: 00092A6E	MQ03	GREETING	0	I heard about how you helped the Guard drive the daedra back. Well done.	
FormID: 00082DC4	MQ03	GREETING	0	I wondered if you'd come back. I admit, I've had my doubts about your story.	
FormID: 0001E8D2	MQ03	GREETING	0	Unless you need something, let's continue on to Weynon Priory.	
FormID: 00034065	MQ03	GREETING	0	Your first priority now should be to find Martin and bring him back here.	
FormID: 0003D7EC	MQ13	GREETING	0	I look forward to fighting by your side again.	
FormID: 0003D7EE	MQ13	GREETING	0	We must protect Martin during the battle. He is the Empire's last hope.	
FormID: 0003D7EF	MQ13	GREETING	0	This is no time for talking!	
FormID: 0003D7F0	MQ13	GREETING	0	Come on. My men will need all the help they can get today.	
FormID: 0003D7F1	MQ13	GREETING	0	I'm only the Captain of the Guard. The Countess makes the final decision, and I follow her orders, whatever I think of them.	
FormID: 00097A6B	MQ13	GREETING	0	The Countess has received word from Cloud Ruler Temple that grave matters are afoot. Nothing else concerns her at the moment.	seriously
FormID: 000272BA	MQ13	GREETING	0	I'm waiting to discuss our battle plans with the Countess. Have you told her to meet me here yet?	
FormID: 000272BB	MQ13	GREETING	0	Let the Countess know I'll be waiting for her in the Chapel of Talos. 	
FormID: 0003D7F2	MQ13	GREETING	0	When you're ready for battle, the Countess will order her men to stop closing the Gates outside the city.	
FormID: 0003D7F3	MQ13	GREETING	0	My place is on the battlefield. The time for hiding in Cloud Ruler Temple is over. Come, let us go down to battle together.	
FormID: 0003D7F4	MQ13	GREETING	0	We must hold the line until the Great Gate opens!	
FormID: 000272BC	MQ13	GREETING	0	Greetings. What news from Cloud Ruler Temple?	
FormID: 000272BD	MQ13	GREETING	0	I will call out my militia if necessary, but must we truly stand alone? I don't think we can survive the daedric onslaught.	
FormID: 000276A3	MQ13	GREETING	0	Some help is better than nothing, but my militia are farmers and shopkeepers, not soldiers. I would recommend delaying until more help can arrive.	
FormID: 000276A4	MQ13	GREETING	0	I appreciate the help that you have brought to Bruma. I begin to think we have a chance.	
FormID: 000276A4	MQ13	GREETING	1	But my militia is no substitute for trained soldiers. Can we not wait for more help to arrive?	
FormID: 000276A5	MQ13	GREETING	0	You are a diplomat as well as a warrior, it seems! I would prefer more men, of course, but if we must offer battle now, so be it.	
FormID: 000276A6	MQ13	GREETING	0	I am ready for battle when you are, champion. What say you?	
FormID: 000276A7	MQ13	GREETING	0	Come with me to the Chapel of Talos. I wish to speak with your lord.	
FormID: 0003D7F5	MQ13	GREETING	0	Your place is on the battlefield. I have trusted you this far. Do not fail me.	
FormID: 0003C145	MQ13	GREETING	0	We won't let you down, sir. The daedra will be sorry they messed with Bruma.	
FormID: 0003C146	MQ13	GREETING	0	We won't let you down, ma'am. The daedra will be sorry they messed with Bruma.	
FormID: 0003D8C1	MQ13	GREETING	0	Send them back to Oblivion! We'll hold the city in case any of them break through.	
FormID: 0003D7F9	MQ13	GREETING	0	I wish we had more real soldiers.	
FormID: 0003D7FA	MQ13	GREETING	0	We'll stand our ground as long as we can.	
FormID: 000270EA	MQ12	GREETING	0	You're back. And you've got the Great Stone...	[mild surprise, anxiety -- implies concern for the player][CRLF]
FormID: 000270E9	MQ12	GREETING	0	The last item for the ritual still eludes me, I'm afraid. The Mysterium Xarxes gives up its secrets reluctantly.	
FormID: 000270E9	MQ12	GREETING	1	The supporting glyphs all point to Oblivion, but the signifier of the main symbol matches nothing ... 	almost to himself
FormID: 000270E9	MQ12	GREETING	2	I'm sorry to burden you with my problems. I'll do my best to have an answer by the time you return with the Great Welkynd Stone.	
FormID: 0002711A	MQ12	GREETING	0	I've made no progress on the fourth item. And every day that passes brings the Mythic Dawn closer to victory.	
FormID: 00026D5E	MQ08	GREETING	0	My research is moving forward again. It's only a matter of time before I decipher the third and fourth ingredients for the ritual.	
FormID: 0002006A	MQ07	GREETING	0	I hope Martin knows what he's doing with that evil book. I fear for what it could do to him if he's not careful.	
FormID: 0002006B	MQ07	GREETING	0	What have you learned about the spies?	
FormID: 0002006D	MQ07	GREETING	0	I need some time to study the Mysterium Xarxes. I'll let you know when I learn something.	
FormID: 0002006E	MQ07	GREETING	0	I've deciphered part of the ritual needed to open a portal to Camoran's Paradise.	
FormID: 0002006E	MQ07	GREETING	1	The Xarxes mentions four items needed for the ritual, but so far I have only deciphered one of them: the 'blood of a Daedra Lord'.	
FormID: 0002006E	MQ07	GREETING	2	In fact, daedric artifacts are known to be formed from the essence of a Daedric Lord, from whence they derive their great power.	
FormID: 0002006E	MQ07	GREETING	3	Not an easy thing to come by, obviously, but we will need a daedric artifact. Bring it to me when you have acquired one.	
FormID: 000221F5	MQ07	GREETING	0	I've made some progress on the Mysterium Xarxes. I think I've identified the section that deals with opening a portal to Camoran's Paradise.	
FormID: 00020070	MQ07	GREETING	0	I'm still studying the Mysterium Xarxes. Its corrupting power is terrible.	
FormID: 00097CAB	MQ06	GREETING	0	Shh. The Master is speaking!	
FormID: 00036408	MQ06	GREETING	0	Dawn is breaking.	REC: slowly, somewhat sinister
FormID: 0001F146	MQ06	GREETING	0	I am Harrow, Warden of the Shrine of Dagon.	
FormID: 0001F146	MQ06	GREETING	1	By following the Path of Dawn hidden in the writings of the Master, Mankar Camoran, you have earned a place among the Chosen.	
FormID: 0001F146	MQ06	GREETING	2	You have arrived at an opportune time. You may have the honor to be initiated into the Order by the Master himself.	
FormID: 0001F146	MQ06	GREETING	3	As a member of the Order of the Mythic Dawn, everything you need will be provided for you from the Master's bounty.	
FormID: 0001F146	MQ06	GREETING	4	Give me your possessions, and put on this initiate's robe.	
FormID: 00036409	MQ06	GREETING	0	Come. Your initiation awaits.	
FormID: 0003640A	MQ06	GREETING	0	You may not leave here until your initiation is complete. Lord Dagon thirsts for red-drink. Sate him.	
FormID: 00024E51	MQ06	GREETING	0	You have come to dedicate yourself to Lord Dagon's service.	
FormID: 00024E51	MQ06	GREETING	1	This pact must be sealed with red-drink, the blood of Lord Dagon's enemies.	
FormID: 00024E51	MQ06	GREETING	2	Take up the dagger and offer Lord Dagon the sacrificial red-drink as pledge of your own life's blood, which shall be his in the end.	
FormID: 00024E53	MQ06	GREETING	0	Well done. You are now a member of the Order of the Mythic Dawn, one of the Chosen. Your life belongs to Lord Dagon.	
FormID: 00024E54	MQ06	GREETING	0	You must slay the sacrifice to bind yourself fully to Lord Dagon's service. Lord Dagon thirsts for blood.	
FormID: 0001FB2F	MQ06	GREETING	0	Harrow awaits within. You should not linger here.	
FormID: 0002006C	MQ06	GREETING	0	Good work locating the Shrine of Dagon. If you can retrieve the Amulet of Kings, we may yet prevail.	
FormID: 0002006F	MQ06	GREETING	0	You need to get the Mysterium Xarxes from the Mythic Dawn's Shrine of Dagon. It is our only hope to retrieve the Amulet of Kings.	
FormID: 00020073	MQ06	GREETING	0	Thank Talos you've returned safely!	
FormID: 00020073	MQ06	GREETING	1	Do you have the Amulet?	hoping against hope. afraid of the answer.
FormID: 0008B614	MQ06	GREETING	0	You should talk to Martin. He'll want to see the Mysterium Xarxes right away.	
FormID: 0008B604	MQ06	GREETING	0	Ah, you're back. I told Jauffre not to worry. 	
FormID: 0008B604	MQ06	GREETING	1	... I can see you have bad news. You didn't recover the Amulet, did you?	
FormID: 0003640B	MQ06	GREETING	0	Where am I? What is this place? Arkay preserve me, I remember now ... hooded men grabbed me as I was leaving the Temple ...	
FormID: 0003640B	MQ06	GREETING	1	We must get out of here! Come on!	
FormID: 0003640C	MQ06	GREETING	0	By all that is holy, we must get out of this hellish place!	
FormID: 0003640D	MQ06	GREETING	0	Thank you for saving me, friend. I don't know who you are, but it is clear that Akatosh guides you.	
FormID: 0003640D	MQ06	GREETING	1	I am a priest in the Temple of the One in the Imperial City. Perhaps our paths will cross again one day.	
FormID: 0003640E	MQ06	GREETING	0	Welcome, brother. You are one of the Chosen now.	
FormID: 00036410	MQ06	GREETING	0	Welcome, sister. You are one of the Chosen now.	
FormID: 0003664E	MQ06	GREETING	0	Is there something you require?	
FormID: 00036414	MQ06	GREETING	0	Your blood will satisfy Lord Dagon just as well as the prisoner's. It will be our honor to spill your blood for Him, if you choose that path.	
FormID: 00036415	MQ06	GREETING	0	Slay the sacrifice. Lord Dagon thirsts for blood.	
FormID: 00036416	MQ06	GREETING	0	How can I serve you, brother?	
FormID: 00036420	MQ06	GREETING	0	How can I serve you, sister?	
FormID: 00037CEA	MQ05	GREETING	0	You have proven yourself a loyal servant of the Empire, as worthy as any of the Blades to stand by Martin's side during this crisis.	
FormID: 00037CEA	MQ05	GREETING	1	As the Grandmaster of the Blades, I would be honored to accept you into our order. Will you join us?	
FormID: 0001EFDE	MQ05	GREETING	0	It is good to be back here. It raises my spirits just to walk these ancient halls again. We will prevail. We must prevail!	
FormID: 00022B11	MQ05	GREETING	0	Sit down. Don't say anything. Just do what I say.	
FormID: 00022B12	MQ05	GREETING	0	I'm being watched. Just sit down. Don't say anything.	
FormID: 00022B13	MQ05	GREETING	0	Listen. I'm going to get up in a minute and walk out of here. That guy in the corner behind me will follow me. You follow him.	
FormID: 00022B19	MQ05	GREETING	0	I told you to stay back and keep an eye on the guy who was watching me.	
FormID: 00022B1A	MQ05	GREETING	0	Search his body. I'll keep an eye out, in case any of his friends are nearby.	
FormID: 00022B1D	MQ05	GREETING	0	Good work. I am glad to see you, by the way. You just caught me at a bad time.	
FormID: 00022B8B	MQ05	GREETING	0	You're not easy to get a hold of. What have you found out?	
FormID: 00022CEB	MQ05	GREETING	0	Alright. The room with the table is just through this door. I always wondered who put it there.	
FormID: 00022CEB	MQ05	GREETING	1	I happen to know that if you go up the stairs there, you can get a vantage point on the meeting room.	
FormID: 00022CEB	MQ05	GREETING	2	I think I'd better be the one to handle the meeting. You'll be my backup. Keep watch from above in case of trouble.	
FormID: 00034241	MQ05	GREETING	0	Aren't you supposed to be going to see Tar-Meena? I have plenty of leads of my own to track down, don't worry.	
FormID: 00034242	MQ05	GREETING	0	I think you're onto something with those books. You should finish tracking them all down, and then we'll see what we've got.	
FormID: 00034243	MQ05	GREETING	0	So far Mankar Camoran's books are our best lead. You should keep working on getting copies of all four.	
FormID: 00034244	MQ05	GREETING	0	I know the part of the sewers you were talking about. Follow me, I'll show you.	
FormID: 00022CEC	MQ05	GREETING	0	So, here's the plan. I'll meet with the Sponsor, while you cover me from the upper gallery. What do you think?	
FormID: 0003450F	MQ05	GREETING	0	You're taking the meeting. You'd better get in there before they realize you didn't come alone.	REC: Emphasis on [QUOTE]YOU'RE taking the meeting[QUOTE] (you talked Baurus out of being the point man)
FormID: 00034510	MQ05	GREETING	0	We agreed I would meet the Sponsor. You need to get out of sight before you blow the whole meeting.	
FormID: 00034511	MQ05	GREETING	0	That could have gone smoother. Can't say I minded killing a few more of these bastards, though. Get the book and let's get out of here.	
FormID: 00034512	MQ05	GREETING	0	Get the book and let's go.	
FormID: 00034513	MQ05	GREETING	0	Now that you have all four books, you should be able to handle things from here.	
FormID: 00034513	MQ05	GREETING	1	I'm going to Cloud Ruler Temple. My place is at Martin's side.	
FormID: 00034514	MQ05	GREETING	0	What do you need?	
FormID: 00033FC2	MQ05	GREETING	0	This whole business of being heir to the throne will take some getting used to.  Please bear with me.	
FormID: 00033FCD	MQ05	GREETING	0	While I'm getting oriented here, you should follow Jauffre's orders.	
FormID: 00094C35	MQ05	GREETING	0	Move along, friend.	REC: menacingly
FormID: 000C099D	MQ05	GREETING	0	Ah. You must be the one I got the message about. How can I help you?	
FormID: 000A31C3	MQ05	GREETING	0	You were told to sit down. Are you incapable of following such simple instructions?	DUPLICATE THE ALREADY RECORDED VOICE FILE: MQ05_MQ05RavenSpeech_00022DA9_1
FormID: 00094C37	MQ05	GREETING	0	I'm sorry, but I'm late for an appointment. I've no time to talk now.	
FormID: 00094C38	MQ05	GREETING	0	You must not have heard me the first time. Good day!	
FormID: 00094C39	MQ05	GREETING	0	Are you deaf? Leave me alone!	
FormID: 0001EE23	MQ04	GREETING	0	Help! You must help! They're killing everyone at Weynon Priory!	
FormID: 0001EE24	MQ04	GREETING	0	Are they gone? Is it safe to come back?	
FormID: 00033DF3	MQ04	GREETING	0	Gods blood! They came out of nowhere. Have you seen Grandmaster Jauffre?	out of breath (after a battle)
FormID: 0009098D	MQ04	GREETING	0	Come on! We need to help the Grandmaster!	
FormID: 00033DF4	MQ04	GREETING	0	Poor Prior Maborel. He was dead when I came outside. Who could have done this?	
FormID: 00033DF5	MQ04	GREETING	0	Thanks for your help. I didn't think any of us were going to survive the attack.	
FormID: 0001EE25	MQ04	GREETING	0	You're back. Thank Talos!	
FormID: 0001EE25	MQ04	GREETING	1	They attacked without warning. I was praying in the Chapel when I heard Prior Maborel shout. I had just time to arm myself.	
FormID: 0001EE25	MQ04	GREETING	2	The Amulet of Kings! I fear that was the target of this attack. I kept it in a secret room in Weynon House.	
FormID: 0001EE25	MQ04	GREETING	3	We need to go see if it is safe.	
FormID: 0001EE26	MQ04	GREETING	0	The Amulet ... is it safe?	
FormID: 00090B4F	MQ04	GREETING	0	They've taken it! The Amulet of Kings is gone! The enemy has defeated us at every turn!	
FormID: 0001EE27	MQ04	GREETING	0	As a Blade, my place is at Martin's side.	
FormID: 0009098E	MQ04	GREETING	0	I think we should find your friend Jauffre at once.	
FormID: 0009098F	MQ04	GREETING	0	Do you think there are any more of those assassins about?	
FormID: 0006B1B2	MQ04	GREETING	0	Let's continue on to Cloud Ruler Temple. I haven't had a good night's sleep since Kvatch was attacked.	
FormID: 0001EFE0	MQ04	GREETING	0	Not much of a speech, was it? Didn't seem to bother them, though.	Ruefully
FormID: 0001EFE0	MQ04	GREETING	1	The Blades saluting me and hailing me as Martin Septim...	bemused ... not quite believing the situation he's now in
FormID: 0001EFE0	MQ04	GREETING	2	I don't mean to sound ungrateful. I know I would be dead by now if it weren't for you. Thank you.	seriously
FormID: 0001EFE0	MQ04	GREETING	3	But everyone expects me to suddenly know what to do. How to behave.	
FormID: 0001EFE0	MQ04	GREETING	4	They want an Emperor to tell them what to do. And I haven't the faintest idea...	
FormID: 00064F38	MQ04	GREETING	0	Let's not keep the Blades waiting.	
FormID: 0001DC44	MQ02	GREETING	0	Hello. I'm Brother Jauffre. Can I help you?	friendly but non-commital
FormID: 0001DC8A	MQ02	GREETING	0	I'm Brother Jauffre. What do you want?	wary, assumes you don't have business worth your time
FormID: 000AA08D	MQ02	GREETING	0	Excuse me. Can I help you? Are you looking for Prior Maborel? Or Jauffre?	REC
FormID: 000AA092	MQ02	GREETING	0	Yes? Can I help you?	
FormID: 00036645	MQ09	GREETING	0	So, Martin wants you to recover the Armor of Tiber Septim? I wish there was another way.	
FormID: 00036645	MQ09	GREETING	1	The Armor is in the Shrine of Tiber Septim, in the catacombs beneath the ruins of Sancre Tor. A holy place, once.	
FormID: 00036645	MQ09	GREETING	2	But Sancre Tor became evil long ago. No one has returned from the Shrine of Tiber Septim for many lifetimes.	
FormID: 00026D59	MQ09	GREETING	0	I'm worried about Martin. He does nothing but pore over that evil book all day.	
FormID: 00038FC0	MQ09	GREETING	0	Have you recovered the Armor of Tiber Septim yet? We need to open the gate to Camoran's Paradise as soon as Martin deciphers the whole ritual.	
FormID: 00027119	MQ09	GREETING	0	My progress on the Mysterium Xarxes is slow, I'm afraid. How goes your search for the Armor of Tiber Septim?	
FormID: 00036646	MQ09	GREETING	0	We have fulfilled our last duty. We go now to Aetherius without shame. Farewell.	REC: slower -- the voice of a ghost. muted emotion.
FormID: 00036647	MQ09	GREETING	0	At long last ... you have freed me. Now I can finally complete my lord's last request.	REC: slower -- the voice of a ghost. muted emotion, it is an effort to concentrate on speaking to you.
FormID: 00036648	MQ09	GREETING	0	Why do you disturb me? I must free the Shrine so that I can sleep. It has been so long since I have slept.	REC: slower -- the voice of a ghost. very weary.
FormID: 00036649	MQ09	GREETING	0	Have you seen Alain or Valdemar? Rielus fell in the lower chamber. We were separated ... the fog blinded us ...	REC: starts panicked, then subsides into weariness as he starts to realize the he is dead, a ghost ... so tired...[CRLF]REE-a-lus
FormID: 00036649	MQ09	GREETING	1	No ... that was the dream. I am awake now. I must fulfill my oath to the Emperor before I can finally rest.	
FormID: 0003664A	MQ09	GREETING	0	I know you. You freed me. Free my brothers, if they are still enslaved. Together we will cleanse the Shrine of the Underking's foul magic.	REC: slower -- the voice of a ghost. muted emotion, it is an effort to concentrate on speaking to you.
FormID: 0003664B	MQ09	GREETING	0	Stand aside in the name of Tiber Septim and the Blades! Hinder me at your peril!	
FormID: 000ADC59	MQ11	GREETING	0	From the Blades, did you say? Jauffre sent you? What's this about? Quickly, now.	harrassed, surprised that he might actually be willing to take 1 second for you
FormID: 000A317B	BladesConvSystem	GREETING	0	Please forgive me, but I'm afraid I haven't got time to talk right now. One of the other Blades should be able to assist you. Try Jena or Steffan.	
FormID: 000A317C	BladesConvSystem	GREETING	0	Sorry, but I'm too busy to talk right now. Try one of the other Blades. Perhaps Roliand or Cyrus?	
FormID: 000A317D	BladesConvSystem	GREETING	0	I haven't time to talk right now, I'm afraid. But I'm sure one of the other Blades can help. Try speaking with Belisarius, or Caroline.	
FormID: 0001F104	MQ00	GREETING	0	Dawn is breaking.	
FormID: 00097CAC	MQ00	GREETING	0	I have nothing to say to you.	
FormID: 00026D58	MQ00	GREETING	0	I've figured out another item needed for the ritual to open the portal to Camoran's Paradise.	
FormID: 00026D58	MQ00	GREETING	1	The second item is the counterpart to the first: the blood of a Divine. This was a terrible puzzle to me. 	
FormID: 00026D58	MQ00	GREETING	2	Unlike the Daedra Lords, the gods have no artifacts, and do not physically manifest themselves in our world.	
FormID: 00026D58	MQ00	GREETING	3	How then to obtain the blood of a god? But Jauffre solved it. The blood of Tiber Septim himself, who became one of the Divines.	
FormID: 00026D58	MQ00	GREETING	4	This is a secret remembered only by the Blades, passed down from one Grandmaster to the next. Jauffre should tell it to you himself.	
FormID: 000270EB	MQ00	GREETING	0	Thank Akatosh you're here! I have deciphered the final item for the ritual to open a portal to Camoran's Paradise!	
FormID: 00026D5D	MQ00	GREETING	0	The next section of the Mysterium Xarxes is very difficult. I haven't deciphered the rest of the ritual yet. I hope you are making better progress.	
FormID: 00033FBF	MQ00	GREETING	0	What can I do for you, sir?	
FormID: 00033FC0	MQ00	GREETING	0	What can I do for you, ma'am?	
FormID: 00038FBD	MQ00	GREETING	0	You should be gathering the items Martin needs for the Mysterium Xarxes ritual. There's no time to lose.	
FormID: 0006BED3	MQ00	GREETING	0	A victory beyond hope! You and Martin defeated Mehrunes Dagon in the very moment of his triumph! All hail the Champion of Tamriel!	
FormID: 0006BED4	MQ00	GREETING	0	What can I do for you, Blade?	
FormID: 0006BED5	MQ00	GREETING	0	What can I do for you, Savior of Tamriel?	
FormID: 00038FAB	MQ00	GREETING	0	What is it?	
FormID: 0005D2C6	MQ00	GREETING	0	I know that you are on an important mission for the Blades. Please, if you need a horse, take mine from the Priory stables.	
FormID: 0003C13A	MQ00	GREETING	0	I look forward to fighting these daedra side by side with the Hero of Kvatch.	
FormID: 0003C13C	MQ00	GREETING	0	Let's talk after the battle is won.	
FormID: 0003C13D	MQ00	GREETING	0	Hail, daedra-slayer!	
FormID: 0003C13E	MQ00	GREETING	0	So, you're the famous Hero of Kvatch.	slightly disdainful
FormID: 0003C13F	MQ00	GREETING	0	I'm a bit busy here!	
FormID: 0003C140	MQ00	GREETING	0	Congratulations on your victory. Your fame was well-deserved, it seems.	grudgingly 
FormID: 0003C147	MQ00	GREETING	0	Congratulations on your victory! I admit, I thought your plan would lead to disaster, but you came through for Bruma. I won't forget it.	
FormID: 0003C144	MQ00	GREETING	0	We did it! We showed those damned daedra a thing or two!	
FormID: 00073925	MQ00	GREETING	0	My friend! It is good to see you again. You risked your life to save me, a stranger. You are truly among the blessed of Arkay's children.	smiling -- he is a priest
FormID: 00073925	MQ00	GREETING	1	As a small token of my gratitude, please allow me to share with you some of my small store of knowledge of the healing arts.	
FormID: 00073926	MQ00	GREETING	0	Arkay's blessings upon you.	
FormID: 0003C148	MQ00	GREETING	0	I was honored to fight by your side again.	
FormID: 0006BED7	MQ00	GREETING	0	Martin couldn't have done it without you. I count you among the greatest heroes of the Blades.	
FormID: 0006BED7	MQ00	GREETING	1	To think we'd end up here, after such a beginning! Sending an escaped prisoner off with the Amulet of Kings...	
FormID: 0006BED7	MQ00	GREETING	2	But I never doubted you, my friend. Emperor Uriel, he had the vision of the Dragonborn. He saw something in you. And he was right.	
FormID: 00073927	MQ00	GREETING	0	I never had time to properly thank you for your help back in the Imperial City. I wouldn't have made it back here if it weren't for you.	seriously
FormID: 00073927	MQ00	GREETING	1	Now that we have a free moment, I thought you might be able to use some tricks I've picked up fighting with the Blades over the years.	
FormID: 00073927	MQ00	GREETING	2	Nobody who hasn't trained with the Blades will know these moves, so you should find them useful.	
FormID: 00073927	MQ00	GREETING	3	See, when they swing at you sidearm, you twist your wrist like this... exactly! You're a natural at this. Let me show you another one...	
FormID: 0006BED8	MQ00	GREETING	0	Whatever you need, friend.	
FormID: 0003C149	MQ00	GREETING	0	I wish I could have been at the battle. It sounds like you taught Mehrunes Dagon's boys a lesson they won't soon forget.	
FormID: 0003D7F6	MQ00	GREETING	0	We're going to show them daedra a thing or two, aren't we ma'am?	
FormID: 0003C14A	MQ00	GREETING	0	We're going to show them daedra a thing or two, aren't we sir?	
FormID: 0001E8D0	MQ00	GREETING	0	Thanks for the rescue. I didn't think we would make it out of the Chapel alive. Perhaps Akatosh guided you to us.	
FormID: 00064F39	MQ00	GREETING	0	What is it, my friend?	
FormID: 00058E01	MQ00	GREETING	0	I always wanted to see the Jerall Mountains. Beautiful, aren't they? Almost makes you forget why we're here.	
FormID: 00058E02	MQ00	GREETING	0	I'm sure you hear it all the time, but I'd like to thank you personally for closing that Oblivion Gate outside Cheydinhal.	
FormID: 00058E02	MQ00	GREETING	1	We were all expecting to become the next Kvatch, you know?	
FormID: 00058E02	MQ00	GREETING	2	With the Count worrying more about his son than the defense of the city, things were looking pretty grim.	
FormID: 00058E02	MQ00	GREETING	3	So, like I said, thanks. I'm glad I was able to come here and do my bit for our side, you know?	
FormID: 00058E03	MQ00	GREETING	0	The Mythic Dawn won't dare try anything now that the best soldiers in Cyrodiil are defending Bruma!	
FormID: 00058E04	MQ00	GREETING	0	Remember Kvatch, that's our watchword. We won't let that happen here, don't worry.	
FormID: 00058E05	MQ00	GREETING	0	I can't stay long. Count Caro's orders were to return to Leyawiin as soon as Bruma was safe.	
FormID: 00058E06	MQ00	GREETING	0	Is it always this cold up here? This weather would freeze the arse off an ogre.	
FormID: 00058E07	MQ00	GREETING	0	I hope there are more reinforcements on the way. We can't hold Bruma by ourselves!	
FormID: 00058E08	MQ00	GREETING	0	It's good to see some reinforcements from across Cyrodiil. It's been too long since we all stood together in a common cause.	
FormID: 00058E08	MQ00	GREETING	1	But so few ... surely the other cities will send help?	
FormID: 00058E09	MQ00	GREETING	0	The cities of Cyrodiil are finally rallying together to make a stand against the Oblivion invasion.	
FormID: 00058E09	MQ00	GREETING	1	I'm starting to think we might actually beat these bastards!	
FormID: 0003C141	MQ00	GREETING	0	We won't let those daedra take Bruma.	
FormID: 0003C142	MQ00	GREETING	0	It's the waiting that gets to me. Why don't they just attack and get it over with?	
FormID: 0003C143	MQ00	GREETING	0	You helped our city fight off those damned daedra. Now it's our turn to help Bruma.	
FormID: 000ADC5C	MQ00	GREETING	0	What happened? Where's Martin? I must congratulate him! Mehrunes Dagon is defeated! Cast back into Oblivion! We've won!	in the first flush of triumph -- he's not yet aware there's a downside to victory
FormID: 000ADC5D	MQ00	GREETING	0	Hail, Champion!

FormID: 000176C4	ArenaDialogue	GREETING	3	Kid, you've got more guts. And skill. I think you can take the Gray Prince! Go over and talk to Ysabel if you think I'm right!	
FormID: 000176BE	ArenaDialogue	GREETING	0	I'll be honest, Hero. With the kinds of victories you've been having, I knew that Elf didn't stand a chance. Here's your gold.	
FormID: 0001C0DD	ArenaDialogue	GREETING	0	Defeating an Arena Hero is one thing, but defeating a former member of the Blades? You must be blessed by the Divines or somethin', my friend.	
FormID: 0001C0D7	ArenaDialogue	GREETING	0	By defeating that Breton, you've secured your advancement. It's been a long time since I've said this, but congratulations, Hero.

FormID: 0000085B	MS47	GREETING	0	What is it now?	
FormID: 00030032	MS47	GREETING	0	Excuse me. We have a small problem that we hope you can help us with.	
FormID: 00030032	MS47	GREETING	1	You may be wondering why you can't see me. We are all wondering the same thing.	
FormID: 0003013C	MS47	GREETING	0	Thank you, thank you! I can't tell you how good it feels to be able to see myself again.	
FormID: 0003013C	MS47	GREETING	1	My sisters, on the other hand ... I wouldn't mind if they had stayed invisible! Ha ha ha!

FormID: 0003013D	MS47	GREETING	1	We trusted you to help, and you betrayed us! It would be best if you left this town and never came back.	
FormID: 0003013B	MS47	GREETING	0	Have you talked to Ancotar yet? Can he make us visible again?	
FormID: 000301DC	MS47	GREETING	0	Oh, really? I'm invisible, you say? Thanks for letting me know. Talk to my brother Diram if you want to know all about it.	heavy sarcasm
FormID: 000301DE	MS47	GREETING	0	Sometimes, people who are invisible are trying to get some privacy. Diram will be glad to talk your ear off about the whole mess.	
FormID: 000301DF	MS47	GREETING	0	We've all agreed to let Diram be our spokesman. You'll find him in the inn, if you look very carefully.	
FormID: 000301E2	MS47	GREETING	0	Talk to Diram in the inn. I'm tired of this minstrel's freakshow our town has turned into.

FormID: 00025E14	FG00Expulsion	GREETING	0	First a theft, and now a murder. Your crimes are escalating. You have one final chance. Go out and collect the horns of twenty minotaurs.	
FormID: 00025E14	FG00Expulsion	GREETING	1	If you succeed, perhaps you'll have learned something in that time. If you fail, perhaps you'll be dead, and no longer our problem. Now, go.	
FormID: 00025E15	FG00Expulsion	GREETING	0	Another theft! This is your final chance. Go back into the field, and return to me with the horns of twenty minotaurs.	
FormID: 00025E15	FG00Expulsion	GREETING	1	If you return, perhaps you'll have gained some measure of character. Perhaps, though, you'll die. Then you're no longer the guild's problem.	
FormID: 00025E18	FG00Expulsion	GREETING	0	First you murder, now you steal? Have you gone mad? You're a disgrace. I will offer you one final chance.	
FormID: 00025E18	FG00Expulsion	GREETING	1	Return with 20 minotaur horns if you wish to rejoin the Fighters Guild. Perhaps you'll find redemption; perhaps you'll die trying. Go now.	
FormID: 00025E1C	FG00Expulsion	GREETING	0	So, you've collected the pelts. I trust you've learned a lesson. Your rank is restored, along with all rights and responsibilities.	
FormID: 00025E1D	FG00Expulsion	GREETING	0	You've been told what you must do in order to regain your standing, and you've not yet done it. Don't return until you have twenty bear pelts.	
FormID: 00025E1F	FG00Expulsion	GREETING	0	You've murdered one of your brothers. While we may die in battle, we do not expect to die at the hands of our friends.	
FormID: 00025E1F	FG00Expulsion	GREETING	1	I offer you a chance for redemption. Do not return until you have 20 bear pelts. Take this time to come to terms with what you've done.	
FormID: 00025E20	FG00Expulsion	GREETING	0	You would steal from your brothers? If you had a need for something, why would you not just ask? I will give you a chance, though.	
FormID: 00025E20	FG00Expulsion	GREETING	1	As it is only your first offense, do not return until you have collected 20 bear pelts. Use this time to reflect on your actions.	
FormID: 00025E21	FG00Expulsion	GREETING	0	None in the Fighters Guild will speak with you again. We have no desire to consort with common criminals.

FormID: 0003457E	FGConversations	GREETING	1	She's expelled Oreyn from the guild. Stripped him of all rank and privileges. And you, she's demoted you. You've been busted down to Protector.	REC Orc M[CRLF];oh-RAIN

FormID: 00016E96	SE07B	GREETING	0	You've done it! The Ritual is complete, and you've survived! A shame about Thadon, but it's how he would have wanted to go. Now, on to other...	
FormID: 00016E9E	SE07B	GREETING	0	You have things to do. Talking to me isn't one of them.	
FormID: 0003160B	SE07B	GREETING	0	Happy times! Happy days!	
FormID: 0007DBFF	SE07B	GREETING	0	Once again has the Ritual of Accession come full circle!	
FormID: 0007DBFF	SE07B	GREETING	1	The Blood of Thadon has been consumed by Arden-Sul's will, and all of Mania welcomes you with open arms.	
FormID: 0007DBFF	SE07B	GREETING	2	I now declare you Duchess of Mania of the Shivering Isles! May your light shine upon all our happiest days.	
FormID: 00016EA6	SE07B	GREETING	0	Once again has the Ritual of Accession come full circle!	
FormID: 00016EA6	SE07B	GREETING	1	The Blood of Thadon has been consumed by Arden-Sul's will, and all of Mania welcomes you with open arms.

FormID: 00031613	SE07B	GREETING	0	You've made your choice and forsaken the name Arden-Sul. I have no wish to speak to you.	
FormID: 00016EAA	SE07B	GREETING	0	Sheogorath sent for me and I have arrived. That's all I know.	
FormID: 0007B498	SE07B	GREETING	0	There's no need to mourn. The Ritual has begun! Be happy!	
FormID: 0006A8AD	SE07B	GREETING	0	What can I do for you on this fine, fine day?	
FormID: 000915C2	SE07B	GREETING	0	Well done. I suppose you deserve your new post. Now, if only you stay alive long enough to enjoy it....	Say with air of mystery.
FormID: 000915C6	SE07B	GREETING	0	Well? What are you waiting for? You have the blood, and the altar awaits.	Annoyed
FormID: 00091628	SE07B	GREETING	0	Ugh. How messy. Well, now that you possess Thadon's drug-tainted blood, I'd make my way to the Sacellum as soon as possible.	
FormID: 00091628	SE07B	GREETING	1	Lord Sheogorath doesn't like to be kept waiting.	
FormID: 00091757	SE07B	GREETING	0	Do I have to tell you everything?	Annoyed
FormID: 00091757	SE07B	GREETING	1	You need his blood, so take it! 	Annoyed
FormID: 00091763	SE07B	GREETING	0	You've done it! Color me impressed. On second thought, don't. I like what I'm wearing.	
FormID: 00091763	SE07B	GREETING	1	All that remains is to watch the soon to be late Thadon eat his food and smile with glee as his heart goes [QUOTE]boom.[QUOTE]	
FormID: 00091763	SE07B	GREETING	2	Dinner is promptly at 8 o'clock and those who are late don't get Alocasia Fruit Cup!	lightly scolding
FormID: 000917C9	SE07B	GREETING	0	Choices, choices. Well, now that you've liberated some Greenmote from the Silo, you need to add it to Thadon's food and wine.	
FormID: 000917C9	SE07B	GREETING	1	The kitchens are a good place to start, but they are deep in his quarters guarded by more Saints.	
FormID: 000917C9	SE07B	GREETING	2	So once again you have choices; to sneak or to kill. Be cautious, these Saints are some of his most elite.	
FormID: 000917CA	SE07B	GREETING	0	Watch your step in the Silo. Thadon doesn't want just anyone traipsing through there.	
FormID: 000917CA	SE07B	GREETING	1	You can count on the presence of the Golden Saints to defend his impressive store of Greenmote.	
FormID: 000917CA	SE07B	GREETING	2	You can try to sneak by them or you may elect to eliminate them, but the latter is hardly the way of Mania, now is it?	Sarcasm.
FormID: 00091881	SE07B	GREETING	0	So it's Greenmote you need, eh? Well, I think it's fairly clear who knows where that powdery substance is stored.	
FormID: 00091881	SE07B	GREETING	1	Follow Wide-Eye. I think she mentioned an errand she runs? That would be your best bet.	
FormID: 000918D4	SE07B	GREETING	0	Confused already? How very disappointing.	
FormID: 000918D4	SE07B	GREETING	1	If I were you, and thank Sheogorath that I'm not, I would begin with the people who spend their day closest to Thadon.	
FormID: 00079C09	SE10	GREETING	0	We are all that are left. The others were struck down by Order. How did this happen?

FormID: 00017473	SE10	GREETING	0	No! The Wellspring!...	
FormID: 00017473	SE10	GREETING	1	They've stopped it up. You... you must make it to the Wellspring, and let the waters flow...	
FormID: 00017CFA	SE10	GREETING	0	No! The Wellspring!...	
FormID: 00017CFA	SE10	GREETING	1	They've stopped it up. You... you must make it to the Wellspring, and let the waters flow...	
FormID: 0001ACC0	SE10	GREETING	0	Forgive me, but now is not a time for talk. We must reach the Wellspring with all possible haste. If it is damaged, we are lost.	
FormID: 0001CCF1	SE10	GREETING	0	Forgive me, but now is not a time for talk. We must reach the Wellspring with all possible haste. If it is damaged, we are lost.

FormID: 0001E966	SE10	GREETING	0	You must set me free!	
FormID: 0001E966	SE10	GREETING	1	The barrier can't be broken by you. It's too tough... use the chime! Ring the chime, and that may shatter it!

FormID: 00016ECB	SE10	GREETING	0	We must find Dylora and free her!	
FormID: 00017CFC	SE10	GREETING	0	I am yours to command, Your Grace.	
FormID: 00082471	SE10	GREETING	0	Is Your Grace prepared to enter Brellach now? We cannot delay for long.	
FormID: 00016B37	SE10	GREETING	0	Thank you for coming. I apologize for summoning you. The blame is mine.	
FormID: 00016B37	SE10	GREETING	1	We've lost control of Pinnacle Rock. Syl let them in... We had no idea she would turn on us.	
FormID: 00016B37	SE10	GREETING	2	They captured our commander, Dylora, and have her imprisoned somewhere inside. Our first priority must be rescuing her.	
FormID: 00017D0A	SE10	GREETING	0	Thank you for coming. I apologize for summoning you. The blame is mine.	
FormID: 00017D0A	SE10	GREETING	1	We've lost control of Brellach. Thadon let them in... We had no idea he would turn on us.	
FormID: 00017D0A	SE10	GREETING	2	They captured our commander, Staada, and have her imprisoned somewhere inside. Our first priority must be rescuing her.	
FormID: 0001680F	SE10	GREETING	0	Your Grace, there is trouble! You must come quickly!	
FormID: 0008F514	SE10	GREETING	0	You should be off like the wind, solving problems and doing good deeds!	
FormID: 0008F514	SE10	GREETING	1	And if not good deeds, then deeds of a sort. Strongholds to save, and Daedra to rescue. That sort of thing. Now get going.	
FormID: 00081A53	SE10	GREETING	0	This is a particularly exciting turn of events, is it not?	
FormID: 00081A53	SE10	GREETING	1	A perfect job for you, my newest and only Noble in the realm! If Order has entered my army's stronghold, things have taken a disturbing turn.	
FormID: 00081A53	SE10	GREETING	2	It means Order has tried subterfuge... not its strong suit. Amazing! Perhaps things aren't going as poorly as I'd imagined.	
FormID: 00081A53	SE10	GREETING	3	You'll want to get all the details from the messenger. Unless you already have. You haven't, have you?	
FormID: 0008F046	SE10	GREETING	0	I exist to serve, Your Grace.	
FormID: 0008F048	SE10	GREETING	0	I exist to serve, Your Grace.	
FormID: 0008F049	SE10	GREETING	0	Your Grace must assist us, or we could be lost to this Realm.	
FormID: 0008F04D	SE10	GREETING	0	Your Grace must assist us, or we could be lost to this Realm.	
FormID: 0008F526	SE05	GREETING	0	Gah! Horrid beast! What do you want?	angry, afraid -- trying to shoo away someone he hates
FormID: 0008EBF7	SE05	GREETING	0	You should not be here, Inquisitor. Perhaps you are lost? I have business to attend to. Excuse me.	condescending
FormID: 0008EBF8	SE05	GREETING	0	What... what are you doing here? There's nothing going on. Leave me alone!	shocked, scared
FormID: 0008E8E4	SE05	GREETING	0	You've chosen a side, little one. You'll get what's coming to you eventually.	angry but resigned
FormID: 0008199E	SE05	GREETING	0	What do you want?	condescending
FormID: 00081792	SE05	GREETING	0	You see now what happens when those who oppose me fail, which they always do.	arrogant, gloating
FormID: 00081792	SE05	GREETING	1	I am pleased with your work, Inquisitor. As a token of my appreciation, I shall spare your life, and make you a Courtier of Dementia.	gloating
FormID: 00081792	SE05	GREETING	2	In addition, accept this Bow. May your enemies fear you and never know from where or with what enchantment you shall strike.	arrogant, gloating
FormID: 00081730	SE05	GREETING	0	We shall speak when we've reached the chamber.	annoyed, dismissive
FormID: 000805E7	SE05	GREETING	0	Yes, Inquisitor? What may I do for you?	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 000805E8	SE05	GREETING	0	What brings you to this delightful corner of the House of Dementia? How may I help you?	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 0001AC57	SE05	GREETING	0	Yes? Do you require assistance?	Disinterested, annoyed
FormID: 00081369	SE05	GREETING	0	What news do you have to report, Inquisitor? Have you found who is responsible?	
FormID: 00054CC4	SE05	GREETING	0	I trust you have reconsidered your position. Are you now ready to help me?	
FormID: 00013599	SE05	GREETING	0	What? Do you have business in the House of Dementia?	
FormID: 00043E22	SE05	GREETING	0	Why do you approach the Duchess of Dementia? Do you seek death?	
FormID: 0004301D	SE04	GREETING	0	Yes? Do you require assistance?	
FormID: 0001F4BE	SE04	GREETING	0	Isn't there something you should be doing right now? You know, for example, the things you were specifically told to do?	
FormID: 00013452	SE04	GREETING	0	The triumphant champion returns!	surprised, happy
FormID: 00013452	SE04	GREETING	1	So, do you feel any different? Now that you've been through this experience, I mean.	
FormID: 00013452	SE04	GREETING	2	You know what it's like now... Always wanting that next fix, hating it but craving it at the same time, and hating yourself for all of it.	sympathetic
FormID: 00013452	SE04	GREETING	3	Ah, well. All over now. The Chalice helps, doesn't it? Indeed it does, and I could use some helping right now. I'll just take that back from you.	slightly weary
FormID: 00013452	SE04	GREETING	4	And as a token of my gratitude, I grant you the role of Courtier of Mania, with all of its entitlements.	amused, aloof
FormID: 00013452	SE04	GREETING	5	Which is to say, none.	
FormID: 00013386	SE04	GREETING	0	Why do you speak to me, when you have the Chalice but have not yet returned it?	surprised, annoyed
FormID: 00018C8E	SE04	GREETING	0	Well, look at you. A change for the better, or for the worst? We'll have to see, won't we?	amused
FormID: 0001330C	SE04	GREETING	0	Didn't we have this conversation already? Or was that someone else... No, it was me. And you. And so you know what you should be doing right now.	slightly annoyed
FormID: 0001330C	SE04	GREETING	1	The Chalice, remember? Don't forget, because if I forget then no one will remember, and it might cease to exist. Reality is fickle like that.	slightly concerned
FormID: 000131D3	SE04	GREETING	0	Ahh yes, THERE you are! You couldn't imagine how long I've been waiting for you. So little to do, and so much time.	surprised yet distracted
FormID: 000131D3	SE04	GREETING	1	Hmm, could you, in fact, imagine just how long I've been waiting? I don't think you could, but I might be wrong. I might also not care. Which is it?	aloof
FormID: 0001E3FF	SE04	GREETING	0	You've been speaking to Thadon. I can tell. He has a certain... effect on people.	
FormID: 0001E3FF	SE04	GREETING	1	Did he mention me, perhaps? Or was there something else you wanted to discuss?	
FormID: 0001E400	SE04	GREETING	0	Yes? How may I assist you? I'd be happy to help, if helping you means helping Thadon.	
FormID: 000131D4	SE04	GREETING	0	Yes, hatchling? Do you seek Thadon?	
FormID: 000131D5	SE04	GREETING	0	How can I help you... Sir? Miss? You all look alike to me. It's so hard to tell. Are you here to see Thadon?	
FormID: 00028BDF	MG05FIN	GREETING	0	I'll not have anything to do with you. Begone.	
FormID: 00022508	MG05A	GREETING	0	I've already given you everything you need. Unless I'm mistaken, we have little more to say to one another.	
FormID: 00022509	MG05A	GREETING	0	Hello, my little friend. I have something that might interest you...	
FormID: 00022509	MG05A	GREETING	1	I've committed most of the book to memory, but I took the time to write down a passage you might find useful.	
FormID: 00022509	MG05A	GREETING	2	It contains instructions for acquiring a very special power. You'll want to read it carefully, and then return to Cloud Top.	
FormID: 00022509	MG05A	GREETING	3	I consider this to be more than a worthy reward for your help; I believe you'll agree... assuming you're careful.	
FormID: 00022488	MG05A	GREETING	0	Can't you see I'm busy? Without the translation, this book is useless. Now go away and let me work.	
FormID: 0001E84F	MG05A	GREETING	0	I must put this book in a safe place. I have no time to talk now.	typo
FormID: 000277ED	MG05A	GREETING	0	Back again, are you? Do you have the book THIS time?	
FormID: 00028BF8	MG05A	GREETING	0	Any progress yet? You should be working on getting the book for me.	
FormID: 00028BF8	MG05A	GREETING	1	You don't want to fail me again.	
FormID: 00028BFC	MG05A	GREETING	0	I grow weary of waiting. Where is my book?

FormID: 0000C08D	MG15Helm	GREETING	1	A course of action could not be agreed upon. Some felt that we are in danger of being exterminated, and that it is time to fight back.	
FormID: 0000C08D	MG15Helm	GREETING	2	Others felt it appropriate to fight fire with fire, as it were. The Council has shattered, and artifacts have been lost.	
FormID: 0000C08D	MG15Helm	GREETING	3	The Necromancer's Amulet and the Bloodworm Helm have been taken.

FormID: 00035F37	MG10Vahtacen	GREETING	1	That looks important, whatever it is. I think you've really found something!	
FormID: 00035F37	MG10Vahtacen	GREETING	2	You'd best get that to Irlav back at the Imperial City as soon as possible. He'll want the mages there to examine it more closely.	REC

FormID: 00035F42	MG10Vahtacen	GREETING	1	It's a damned shame. I haven't been giving the project the attention it deserves.	
FormID: 00035F42	MG10Vahtacen	GREETING	2	The last report I received from Skaleel indicated there was some sort of problem. A blocked passage, or something, that they couldn't get past.	
FormID: 00035F42	MG10Vahtacen	GREETING	3	I'd investigate it further, but I'm needed here with the Council. Raminus says you've got a good head on your shoulders.	
FormID: 00035F42	MG10Vahtacen	GREETING	4	Look into it for me, will you? You can find Skaleel at the site. Access is restricted, so you'll need this key.

FormID: 00034861	MG07Leyawiin	GREETING	0	Ah, child. I thank you for helping me.	
FormID: 00034861	MG07Leyawiin	GREETING	1	With the voices quieted for now, the words you seek have come to me. You shall have my... recommendation.	
FormID: 00034861	MG07Leyawiin	GREETING	2	Though I must warn you. I have seen things in your future. Things which may be, and things which will be.	
FormID: 00034861	MG07Leyawiin	GREETING	3	It will be up to you to decide the fate of many. Life and death are strange things, easily manipulated, and both will be altered by your hands.	
FormID: 0001FC4A	MG07Leyawiin	GREETING	0	You seek more from me, child? It is as I have seen.	
FormID: 0001FC4A	MG07Leyawiin	GREETING	1	I know what you would ask. You would bring light to that which is in darkness, bring silence to the voices so loud. I know where you must go.	
FormID: 0001FC4A	MG07Leyawiin	GREETING	2	Blood ran blue, and dragons flew high. Under broken towers and broken bodies it now lies, waiting to be found.	
FormID: 0001FC4A	MG07Leyawiin	GREETING	3	What was my sire's must be mine, if you would have the words you seek. You must go and find his stone.	
FormID: 00034863	MG07Leyawiin	GREETING	0	Nothing has changed, child. The voices still cry out, and I am unable to hear. If they can be sealed away, our work may begin.	
FormID: 0001E065	MG07Leyawiin	GREETING	0	Have you reconsidered, child? Will you aid me?	
FormID: 0002DB93	MG07Leyawiin	GREETING	0	You seek wisdom from me, child? Ah, no. You seek words.	
FormID: 0002DB93	MG07Leyawiin	GREETING	1	Words are... difficult. They come and go. The voices, though. So loud they are, they drown out the words.	
FormID: 0002DB93	MG07Leyawiin	GREETING	2	Without my amulet, my stone to lock the voices away, the words will never come and stay.	
FormID: 0002DB93	MG07Leyawiin	GREETING	3	Would you lift your hands to help another, to help me find the words?	
FormID: 0002DB95	MG07Leyawiin	GREETING	0	You speak, yet I cannot hear. You listen, yet I cannot speak. When the voices grow quiet, then shall our time be at hand.

FormID: 0001F85E	MG06Bruma	GREETING	0	What, you couldn't be bothered to find out what Volanaro wanted you to do? 	
FormID: 0001F85E	MG06Bruma	GREETING	1	And it would've been so much fun, too.	
FormID: 0001F85E	MG06Bruma	GREETING	2	Well, you found me. Congratulations. Go tell Jeanne, if you must.	
FormID: 0001F85F	MG06Bruma	GREETING	0	Oh, you're no fun at all!	
FormID: 0001F85F	MG06Bruma	GREETING	1	It was just a harmless little prank, that's all. Why did you have to go and ruin it?	
FormID: 0001F85F	MG06Bruma	GREETING	2	Well, I guess we'll go back to the drawing board. Fine, go tell Jeanne you found me. I was getting tired of being invisible all the time, anyway.

FormID: 00022500	Dark01KnifeFIN	GREETING	0	Warmest greetings to you. I trust you've already spoken with Ocheeva? I am Vicente Valtieri. I provide assignments for all new family members.	
FormID: 00022500	Dark01KnifeFIN	GREETING	1	Please, do not let my appearance... unnerve you. The needs and Tenets of the Dark Brotherhood come before my own needs as a vampire.	
FormID: 00022500	Dark01KnifeFIN	GREETING	2	Now, if you're ready to get to work, I can provide you with your first contract.  	
FormID: 00023E2E	Dark01KnifeFIN	GREETING	0	I trust you've had time to get settled? The contract is available whenever you are.	
FormID: 00023E44	Dark01KnifeFIN	GREETING	0	Greetings once more. I know you must be eager to get to work. I think you'll find the task Vicente has available to be quite intriguing.	
FormID: 000253B7	Dark04ExecutionFIN	GREETING	0	I have a special contract that needs fulfillment. In truth, I don't wish to offer it to any other family member. I've come to rely on your abilities.	
FormID: 00019132	Dark02Watery	GREETING	0	So, the pirate has been eliminated. Excellent. No one will mourn his passing, and Sithis has been appeased. 	
FormID: 00019132	Dark02Watery	GREETING	1	Please accept this Black Band as your reward. It is a ring whose powers are quite useful to those who value... discretion.	
FormID: 000232CB	Dark02Watery	GREETING	0	Let's not waste time on pleasantries. Gaston Tussaud is still alive, and it's your job to remedy that. I suggest you tend to your duties.	
FormID: 00023F09	Dark02Watery	GREETING	0	I see you've accepted the contract from Vicente. Very good. With every life you take, Sithis grows stronger, and the Brotherhood flourishes.	
FormID: 00023F34	Dark02Watery	GREETING	0	What in blazes! You ain't one of me crew! Ye best start explainin' yerself, mate, if ye want to get off this ship alive!	
FormID: 00023E2F	Dark02WateryFIN	GREETING	0	I'm glad you've returned. The contract is waiting, if you're ready.	
FormID: 00023E50	Dark03AccidentsFIN	GREETING	0	Back for more? It just so happens I have another contract available, one that requires an expert in infiltration.	
FormID: 000251B6	Dark04Execution	GREETING	0	Why does Valen Dreth still live? Breaking into the Imperial Prison is difficult, I know, but the contract must be fulfilled.	
FormID: 000251B9	Dark04Execution	GREETING	0	So, you infiltrated the Imperial Prison, eliminated Valen Dreth, and killed not one guard. Most excellent!	
FormID: 000251B9	Dark04Execution	GREETING	1	In addition to your standard reward, I present to you this bonus. Behold, the Scales of Pitiless Justice! 	
FormID: 000251B9	Dark04Execution	GREETING	2	While carried, the scales will magically enhance your Strength, Intelligence and Agility... but diminish your Personality. A powerful tool indeed.	
FormID: 000251BC	Dark04Execution	GREETING	0	Valen Dreth lies dead, but why the unsanctioned bloodshed? You seem to lack... discipline. Here is your reward, but I'm afraid the bonus is forfeit. 	
FormID: 00025273	Dark04Execution	GREETING	0	Wait, I know you... You... You're the one! That day the Emperor was killed! They went through your cell! You lucky bastard! But... You came back?	
FormID: 00025273	Dark04Execution	GREETING	1	Come on, you've got to help me! Let old Valen out of this cell! You've got your freedom, now give me mine! What do you say, huh? Come on, friend!	
FormID: 0004CAD8	Dark04Execution	GREETING	0	Wait, I know you... You... You're the one! That day the Emperor was killed! They went through your cell! You lucky strumpet! But... You came back?	
FormID: 0004CAD8	Dark04Execution	GREETING	1	Come on, you've got to help me! Let old Valen out of this cell! You've got your freedom, now give me mine! What do you say, huh? Come on, friend!	
FormID: 0002E91D	Dark04Execution	GREETING	0	You dare torment me? Valen Dreth? Let me out of this cell, you fetid piece of Guar dung!	
FormID: 000253B6	Dark05Assassinated	GREETING	0	Oh! Well... um, hello. You must be the one Lucien Lachance told me about. I've been expecting you. We haven't got much time, I'm afraid.	
FormID: 000253B6	Dark05Assassinated	GREETING	1	I borrowed quite a bit of gold from some underworld types.  I... I missed a payment. Now they don't even want the money. They say I insulted them!	
FormID: 000253B6	Dark05Assassinated	GREETING	2	They've sent an enforcer to kill me! His name is Hides-His-Heart, and he's on his way here now! That's why I hired you! So you can fake my death!	
FormID: 0002F08C	Dark05Assassinated	GREETING	0	Now is not the time!	
FormID: 0002F08D	Dark05Assassinated	GREETING	0	Ohhh... I'm a bit stiff, but quite fine otherwise. Ah yes, the Undercroft. My family members are buried here, you know.	
FormID: 0002F08D	Dark05Assassinated	GREETING	1	Which... um... leads me to something I may have failed to mention before. My ancestors will see my [QUOTE]revival[QUOTE] as a desecration of their tomb.	
FormID: 0002F08D	Dark05Assassinated	GREETING	2	This Undercroft is... well... quite cursed. Any desecration will cause my ancestors to rise from their graves and defend their resting place.	
FormID: 0002F08D	Dark05Assassinated	GREETING	3	I can hear them coming as we speak! You must protect me... escort me to the Gray Mare where I can buy passage out of Chorrol!	
FormID: 0002F08D	Dark05Assassinated	GREETING	4	*Gasp!* Here they come! Oh my, Aunt Margaret! You are looking the worse for wear...	
FormID: 0002D393	Dark05Assassinated	GREETING	0	Ah, so Motierre has escaped? Well done! As payment, I am pleased to award you this amulet, Cruelty's Heart, as well as another advancement in rank.	
FormID: 0002D393	Dark05Assassinated	GREETING	1	I hereby bestow upon you the title of Eliminator. Your blood is cold, your heart hard. You exemplify everything the Dark Brotherhood stands for.	
FormID: 0002D393	Dark05Assassinated	GREETING	2	I present to you now this key. It unlocks the well behind the Abandoned House above. Use it to gain hidden, quick access to this Sanctuary.	
FormID: 0002D3A3	Dark05Assassinated	GREETING	0	So, you are here to kill Motierre, eh? Well he's mine, and nothing will stand in my way!	
FormID: 0002EE29	Dark05Assassinated	GREETING	0	Is it not safe? Do you want me to wait here?	
FormID: 0002EE2D	Dark05Assassinated	GREETING	0	Ah, the Gray Mare! From here I will be able to arrange for transportation out of Cyrodiil! You have served me well, assassin.	
FormID: 0002EE2D	Dark05Assassinated	GREETING	1	Francois is forever in your debt! Farewell!	
FormID: 0002EE2E	Dark05Assassinated	GREETING	0	Thanks again, assassin. Your services have been invaluable. Soon I will find passage out of Cyrodiil, and be rid of those moneylenders forever!	
FormID: 0002EE2F	Dark05Assassinated	GREETING	0	So, the enforcer Hides-His-Heart has been killed. He was to bear witness to Motierre's death, and report back to his superiors.  	
FormID: 0002EE2F	Dark05Assassinated	GREETING	1	By failing to fulfill this contract, you have brought shame upon us all. Leave me now, and contemplate your uselessness as a member of this family.	
FormID: 0002EE30	Dark05Assassinated	GREETING	0	So, Francois Motierre has been killed. He hired us, sacrificed his own mother's blood, and we could not even fulfill our end of the bargain.	
FormID: 0002EE30	Dark05Assassinated	GREETING	1	By failing to fulfill this contract, you have brought shame upon us all. Leave me now, and contemplate your uselessness as a member of this family.	
FormID: 00092D75	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Ha ha! We did it, my friend! The killer is dead, and this nightmare is just about over. All we have to do now is find a way out of here!	
FormID: 00092D76	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Well, that's that. The killer is dead, and this nightmare is just about over. All we have to do now is find a way out of here.	
FormID: 00092D77	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	It's... It's finally over. The killer is dead. We just... We just need to get out of here...	
FormID: 00092D78	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Oh, can it really be true? Can the killer really be dead? This has been such a nightmare! I just want to find a way out of this house and go home.	
FormID: 000275C0	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	The other guests are waiting for you at Summitmist Manor. I suggest you get going.	
FormID: 000275C1	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Well done! Not only did you kill the five guests, you acted as an agent of terror and grief. You have earned your reward and bonus, Assassin.   	
FormID: 000275C1	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	1	I lay upon you now the Night Mother's Blessing. May she walk with you always, and guide your hand as you act in accordance with the Five Tenets.	
FormID: 000275C2	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	You managed to kill the five house guests, yes. But your inability to remain undetected will cost you. Your bonus for this contract is forfeit.	
FormID: 000275C2	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	1	I must admit, I'm disappointed. This was an important contract, and you stumbled through it like a drunk. Leave me now, and think upon your failure.	
FormID: 000275CC	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	The sixth guest has finally arrived! Well it's about time! Do you know how long we've been waiting? It seems like an age!              	
FormID: 000275CC	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	1	Whoever invited us here must at least know us, don't you think? In any event, we're all stuck here together, so we might as well get acquainted.	
FormID: 000275CC	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	2	The rest of us have already traded introductions. I'm Matilde Petit. The others are Nels the Naughty, Neville, Dovesi Dran and Primo Antonius.	
FormID: 000275CC	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	3	Now, who might you be? Please, tell us a little bit about yourself.	
FormID: 0002797F	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Have you spoken to the other guests yet? I suggest you get to know everyone. Who knows how long we'll be stuck in this house together?	
FormID: 00027980	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Now you listen to me. I don't like you. Understand? So why don't we both just stay out of each other's way, and be done with it.	
FormID: 00027981	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Hello, dear! Listen, I've been thinking. Why don't we form a kind of alliance? If either one of us finds the chest of gold, we split it, 50/50!	
FormID: 00027981	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	1	With the two of us working together, we're sure to find the chest before anyone else. What do you say? Do you want to team up?	
FormID: 00027982	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Oh, hello sweetie. So, no luck yet in finding the gold, I gather? I've been looking as well, but haven't found so much as a clue. 	
FormID: 00028159	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Well, hello there. Nels is my name. Some call me Naughty, but don't you believe it! Hahahaha!	
FormID: 00027986	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	It's funny. I like just about everyone, but the very sight of you makes me sick. Why don't you go look for the gold someplace else, friend. 	
FormID: 00027987	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	I'll let you in on a little secret. If I find the chest of gold, I'm going to open a tavern.  The Hoary Boar! It's been my dream since I was a boy.	
FormID: 0002799A	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Someone's been murdered! By Ysmir's beard, I need a drink!  	
FormID: 0002815A	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Well, my friend, the search is on, eh? I wonder how much gold is actually in the chest? A thousand pieces of gold? Ten thousand? 	
FormID: 0002815A	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	1	I guess it all depends on the size of the chest. The bigger the better, of course, but where would our mysterious host have hidden such a thing?	
FormID: 0002815B	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Someone has been killed. I don't suppose you know anything about that, now do you? 	
FormID: 0002815C	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Have you heard, my friend? One of our fellow guests has been murdered! This bodes ill for our stay, and our search for the gold.	
FormID: 0002815D	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	What do you want from me? For all I know, you could be the killer!   	
FormID: 0002815E	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Oh, this is just horrible! Who could do such a thing? Who could kill a defenseless person in cold blood? Greed truly brings out the worst in people.	
FormID: 0002815F	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Please, sweetie, stay close to me.  The killer might strike again, whoever he... or she... is. 	
FormID: 00028160	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Two people are dead, and for all I know you could be the killer!	
FormID: 00028161	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	My goodness, two of us are now dead! What's going on in this place?  	
FormID: 00028162	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	I've been trying to figure out who our host might be. With two people dead, it almost seems like he set this party up just to kill us all! 	
FormID: 00028163	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Gasp! Oh... oh, it's you. What do you want? Why are you looking at me that way?  	
FormID: 00028164	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Gasp! Oh... oh. I'm sorry. I... my nerves. I just want to get out of here. Three people have been murdered! I'm so very frightened!  	
FormID: 00028165	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Gasp! Oh, thank goodness it's you, sweetie! Please, don't wander too far away. I feel safe with you.	
FormID: 00028166	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Aggh! They're dead! All dead! And you... you're the only one left. It's you! Oh, gracious, no! Stay away from me!	
FormID: 00028167	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Aggh! They're dead! All of them, dead! Why? What's going on here? We need to get out of this place!	
FormID: 00028168	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	We've got to get out of here! You understand me? We're the only ones left! We need to find a way out of this house! Come on!	
FormID: 0002821F	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Hello, I'm Dovesi. I'm very pleased to meet you. Now that you're here, we can really start looking for that chest of gold.	
FormID: 0002821F	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	1	What I mean to say is, before you arrived, we all just sort of glanced around a bit. Now that we're all officially here, we can look in earnest!	
FormID: 00028220	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	It's funny. I don't even know you, and already I don't like you.	
FormID: 00028221	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	This is all so strange, isn't it? I don't know why I was invited to come here, but the gold could really help my family. I do hope I find it.	
FormID: 00028222	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	You seem like a very nice person. I very much want to find the gold, but I wish you luck. May the best guest win. He he. 	
FormID: 00028223	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	I'm sorry, but I don't feel much like talking right now. Someone has been killed! Don't you even care?  	
FormID: 00028224	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	I... I can't believe it's true. One of us is dead... and everyone else is convinced it was no accident. 	
FormID: 00028225	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Why? Why would someone do this? The taking of a life is against every principal I hold dear. It's something I just can't understand. 	
FormID: 00028226	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Two people dead, and you're still alive. I'm sorry, but you're starting to make me nervous. Please go away.	
FormID: 00028227	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Two of us, dead! Who would do this? And why? Is that why we're all here? To be killed like vermin? I feel like I'm going mad!	
FormID: 00028228	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	I don't care about the gold anymore. I just want to get out of here. I'm going to try all the windows and doors, and see if I can't get one open!	
FormID: 00028229	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	No.... no! You... you stay away from me! One of you is the killer... stay away from me! 	
FormID: 0002822A	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Only three of us left... only three... 	
FormID: 0002822B	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Only three of us left. I'm certainly no murderer, and I know it's not you. That leaves one person! We must protect ourselves... find weapons!   	
FormID: 0002822C	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	You... you're the only one left... By Azura, no! Please, please don't kill me. I beg of you! Spare my life! Aggghhh!	
FormID: 0002822D	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Please. Please help me. I don't want to die. I just want to go home. Go home...	
FormID: 0002822E	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	We must escape! Do you understand? We're the only two left! We're next! If we don't find a way out of here, we're going to die!  	
FormID: 00028267	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	So, you finally showed up. It's about time. People of my station are not accustomed to waiting.	
FormID: 00028268	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	I was just beginning to think I had something in common with the other guests. And then you showed up.	
FormID: 00028269	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Well, here we all are. It's funny how money can bring people together, don't you think?  	
FormID: 0002826A	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	So, are you ready to search for the chest of gold? I'm confident I'll find it. Not that I need the money, of course. My family is quite wealthy.  	
FormID: 000286D0	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Get away from me, peasant. Someone has been murdered, and I'm rather unnerved by the whole thing.  	
FormID: 000286D1	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Did you hear? Someone has been murdered! One of us! One of the guests!   	
FormID: 000286D2	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	I'm beginning to get a bad feeling about all of this. I'd leave right now, if I could. The money means nothing to me. I just thought it would be fun.	
FormID: 000286D3	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Two people are dead, and for all I know you could have killed them! Just leave me alone, you worthless peasant!	
FormID: 000286D4	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Two people are now dead. And for what? A trunk full of coins? How pathetic.  	
FormID: 000286D5	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Dear friend, have you heard? Two of the guests now lie dead! If I find out who did it, I may have to take matters into my own hands. 	
FormID: 000286D6	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	You... you're still alive... For all I know, you're the killer! You stand your ground, or so help me they'll be blood between us.  	
FormID: 000286D7	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Three people now dead, and yet the two of us still live. Do you think I'm the killer? Because I most certainly wonder the same thing about you.  	
FormID: 000286D8	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Dear friend, three of the guests have been killed! You and I, we must stay close. Band together, for mutual protection!  	
FormID: 000286D9	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	You... you murdering dog! How could you have killed all those people? For the gold, is that it? You filthy peasant!   	
FormID: 000286DA	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	I... I don't understand. You're the only one left. Why weren't you killed? No... no... it can't be... 	
FormID: 00028717	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Listen to me! The others, they're all dead! Someone has been coming in here and killing them! That means there must be a way out!   	
FormID: 0002871F	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Well, look at you. Two people have been horribly murdered, and you're right as rain. Strikes me as odd, that does.	
FormID: 00028720	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Two people, dead. If anyone else drops, I swear I'm going to gather every drop of alcohol in this house and drink myself into a stupor.	
FormID: 00028721	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	I haven't seen death like this in a long, long time. It's a bit more than my nerves can handle, I'm afraid. 	
FormID: 00028721	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	1	I plan to gather up every drop of drink in this house and keep it to myself, if things get any worse around here. I find comfort there, you see.	
FormID: 00028722	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	You're enjoying all of this, aren't you? You like seeing us squirm! What in blazes is going on here? Do you have something to do with this?	
FormID: 00028723	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Three people... murdered. I know I shouldn't go wandering off alone right now, but for the love of Ysmir, I need a drink!	
FormID: 00028723	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	1	I need to find some real spirits. I think I saw some mead down in the basement. I don't care if it's not safe! It's my nerves! I need to calm down.	
FormID: 00028724	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	My friend, please stay safe! Three of us have been murdered! Besides you and me, there's only one guest left, if you know what I'm saying.	
FormID: 00028724	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	1	I've seen death like this before. Many years ago, my daughter was murdered by bandits who came to our village. I'm sorry... I... I need a drink.	
FormID: 000852DC	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Please, not now. I just want to be by myself for a bit.	
FormID: 00028725	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	By the gods, you're the only one left. It was you! How could you? How could you have killed all those people? You won't take me so easily!	
FormID: 00028726	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	You! What do you want? If you're looking for something to drink, I can't help you. It's mine. It's all mine. It's the only thing I have...	
FormID: 00028727	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	You want to know something, my friend? I just don't care anymore. We're the only two left. I know I didn't kill those people, so that leaves you.	
FormID: 00028727	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	1	And now you're here to kill me, right? Well, let's get this over with.	
FormID: 00028B7D	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Ah yes, the sixth guest. I'm Neville. It's nice to make your acquaintance.	
FormID: 00028B7E	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	You're starting to crowd me, friend. Why don't you just back off, eh?  	
FormID: 00028B7F	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Well, that chest of gold is supposed to be in here somewhere. Though why someone would invite us all here just to give it away is quite the mystery.	
FormID: 00028B80	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	You want my honest opinion? This whole setup -- the party, the chest of gold -- it doesn't make any sense. 	
FormID: 00028B80	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	1	Why would someone invite us here? Why would they just give away an entire chest of gold? If I didn't know better, I'd say this whole thing is a trap.	
FormID: 00028B80	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	2	So, why am I here? Greed, my friend. I need the gold. I served the Legion proudly for twenty-three years, but pride doesn't put food on my table.	
FormID: 00028B81	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Someone's been killed, and as far as I'm concerned, you're one of the prime suspects. You watch your step. 	
FormID: 00028B82	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Locked inside a house with five strangers. It sounded like  a trap when I read the invitation. Looks like I was right!  	
FormID: 00028B83	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	A guest has been murdered. So it begins. You mark my words. This entire party is a trap. Someone wants us all dead, and now they have their chance.	
FormID: 00028BE9	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Well, well, look who's here. It's the number one suspect in the cold-blooded murder of two innocent people. I'm watching you, scum.	
FormID: 00028BEA	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	I'd say that with two people dead, it's time for everyone to pull together. We need to watch out for each other, stay in a group. 	
FormID: 00028BEB	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	We're being stalked, like animals in the forest. I'm still not sure if the killer is one of the other guests, or is hiding somewhere in the house.	
FormID: 00028BEB	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	1	One thing I do know is that the killer won't just stop with two. They never do. You and I, we need to watch each other's backs.	
FormID: 00028BEB	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	2	I've got my old Legion armor and sword in a chest upstairs. It's time I geared up and showed this coward just who he's dealing with!	
FormID: 0008585C	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Don't worry, my friend. I'm going to show this slinking cutthroat how the Imperial Legion takes care of things.	
FormID: 00028BEC	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Come to have a few words before you slit my throat? That's right, I know you did it. I can't prove it yet, but you mark my words: You're going down!	
FormID: 00028BED	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	I've been doing some thinking. About you. It's kind of interesting that you were the last guest to arrive, don't you think?  	
FormID: 00028BED	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	1	And now, three people lie dead, and you look as if you haven't a care in the world. It just looks a bit... suspicious. That's all I'm saying.	
FormID: 00028BEE	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	There you are. Listen, I've searched every inch of this house. It's sealed up tight. There's no way in or out, and there's nobody hiding anyplace.	
FormID: 00028BEE	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	1	That means the killer has been inside with us all along. You and I aren't murderers, so that leaves one person! We must prepare to defend ourselves! 	
FormID: 0008585D	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	There you are. Listen, I've searched every inch of this house. It's sealed up tight. There's no way in or out, and there's nobody hiding anyplace.	
FormID: 0008585D	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	1	That means the killer has been inside with us all along. You and I aren't murderers, so that leaves one person! It's Nels the Naughty!	
FormID: 00028BEF	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Well, here we both are. Retired Imperial Legion officer and hired assassin. So, who do you work for? The Dark Brotherhood? The Morag Tong? No matter.	
FormID: 00028BEF	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	1	I've faced your kind before. You're a coward. You use stealth and lies to destroy innocent lives. All of that ends now! Prepare to meet your doom!	
FormID: 00028BF1	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	I was wondering when you'd get to me. I have to give you some credit. You had me fooled. You made me trust you, which is not an easy thing.	
FormID: 00028BF1	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	1	Oh, and the chest of gold was a nice touch. I knew it was all too good to be true, but I guess my greed got the best of me.	
FormID: 00028BF1	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	2	But I'm afraid your little game is over now. I've killed more assassins in my day than I can count. So let's get this over with!	
FormID: 00085973	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Well, that's it, my friend. We're the last. And that damned assassin is still hiding out in this house somewhere.	
FormID: 00085973	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	1	I guess there's only one thing left for me to do. I'm going to find an axe and do my best to chop that damn door down and get us out of here!	
FormID: 00085974	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Don't you worry, my friend. I'll get us out of here!	
FormID: 000837E7	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	So, the last guest finally arrives. I'll tell you what I told all the others. You go in, I lock the door. You don't come out 'til it's over.	
FormID: 000837E7	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	1	Now I'll tell you what I didn't tell everyone else. We have the same Mother, you and I. And she wants you to have this. It's the key to the house.	
FormID: 000837E7	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	2	I guess someone else has already told you the other details. Kill all the guests then leave, right? Well, you'd better get in there. Time to mingle. 	
FormID: 000837E8	Dark08Whodunit	GREETING	0	Well, what are you waiting for. There's a party, and you're the guest of honor. All I get to do is lock the damn door. You get to have all the fun.	
FormID: 000275BE	Dark07MedicineFIN	GREETING	0	So, are you ready to mingle with the doomed house guests? The contract is waiting.	
FormID: 0002886B	FGC06Courier	GREETING	0	Haven't you taken care of that weapons shipment yet? Those weapons won't deliver themselves!	
FormID: 0002886C	FGC06Courier	GREETING	0	You here looking for work, meat? Maybe you want a contract?	
FormID: 0002886D	FGC06Courier	GREETING	0	Well, they're all taken care of now. I can't believe we lost Elidor and Brag. Head back to gro-Khash. He won't be happy, but these things happen.	
FormID: 0002886E	FGC06Courier	GREETING	0	Well, they're all taken care of now. It's a damn shame about Elidor. He was a fine swordsman. You should head back to gro-Khash now. Thanks.	
FormID: 0002886F	FGC06Courier	GREETING	0	Well, they're all taken care of now. It's a shame we lost Brag. I'll miss the ugly bastard. You should head back to gro-Khash now. Thanks.	
FormID: 00028870	FGC06Courier	GREETING	0	Well, they're all taken care of now. Good work, there, soldier. Get back to gro-Khash and get your payment.	
FormID: 00028872	FGC06Courier	GREETING	0	We've got to clear out all these goblins. I'll let you know when we've gotten the last of them.	
FormID: 00028874	FGC06Courier	GREETING	0	Give those weapons to the men, and let's get moving.	
FormID: 00028877	FGC06Courier	GREETING	0	You must be the reinforcement from the guild. Good. I hope you brought weapons for us.	
FormID: 00028878	FGC06Courier	GREETING	0	That was some good goblin bashing. What else you need?	
FormID: 0002887B	FGC06Courier	GREETING	0	Right. Let's get to bashing some goblin skulls.	
FormID: 0002887C	FGC06Courier	GREETING	0	You're the one with the weapons shipment, right? Let's talk about that.	
FormID: 0002887F	FGC06Courier	GREETING	0	Well done, my friend. This mine is once again safe for the miners.	
FormID: 00028885	FGC06Courier	GREETING	0	Let's clear this mine of those goblins.	
FormID: 00028886	FGC06Courier	GREETING	0	Ahh... you've got the weapons. Let's talk about that weapons shipment you brought.	
FormID: 0002888B	FGC06Courier	GREETING	0	Good that you made it. You should talk to Rienna.

FormID: 000008D3	Dark05AssassinatedFIN	GREETING	0	Ah, greetings. I have been waiting for you. As Vicente surely told you, your time working with him has come to an end.  	
FormID: 000008D3	Dark05AssassinatedFIN	GREETING	1	From now on, you will receive all assignments directly from me. In fact, your next contract is available now.	
FormID: 0003005B	Dark06WandererFIN	GREETING	0	I have another contract, when you're ready. One that will rely on your ability to remain fully undetected.

FormID: 0002FDB3	Dark10Sanctuary	GREETING	0	The ritual of Purification is complete. Well done. Sithis has been appeased, and the time has come to acknowledge and reward your unwavering loyalty.	Lucien Lachance -- sinister
FormID: 0002FDB3	Dark10Sanctuary	GREETING	1	The Black Hand is most pleased with your progress. You have been invited to share in secrets that few within the Dark Brotherhood even know exist.	
FormID: 0002FDB3	Dark10Sanctuary	GREETING	2	Your life in the Sanctuary is over. Those contracts are behind you. Now, you will serve the Black Hand. You will serve me. 	
FormID: 0002FDB3	Dark10Sanctuary	GREETING	3	From this moment forward, you will walk the shadows as my Silencer. You will receive contracts only from me. Your new life has begun.

FormID: 0002FD92	Dark09RetirementFIN	GREETING	0	I have been waiting for you, assassin. We have not spoken in some time, but I am well aware of your accomplishments within the Dark Brotherhood.	Lucien Lachance -- sinister
FormID: 0002FD92	Dark09RetirementFIN	GREETING	1	That is why I have sent for you. I'm afraid there is a... situation. The time has come to test both your skill and your loyalty to Sithis. 	Lucien Lachance -- sinister
FormID: 0002FD92	Dark09RetirementFIN	GREETING	2	The Black Hand has learned that the Dark Brotherhood has been infiltrated. By whom, and for what purpose, we do not yet know.	Lucien Lachance -- sinister
FormID: 0002FD92	Dark09RetirementFIN	GREETING	3	What we do know is that there is some link between the traitor and the Cheydinhal Sanctuary. The traitor has tainted that place beyond repair.	Lucien Lachance -- sinister
FormID: 0002FD92	Dark09RetirementFIN	GREETING	4	It was learned that the traitor has been active for quite some time, since before you joined the Brotherhood. That absolves you of any suspicion.	Lucien Lachance -- sinister
FormID: 00035E02	Dark09RetirementFIN	GREETING	0	Ah, Assassin, I must speak with you. It is quite urgent. A sealed letter just arrived from a Dark Brotherhood courier.  	
FormID: 00035E02	Dark09RetirementFIN	GREETING	1	I recognize this type of parcel. It contains sealed orders. It's addressed to you... from Lucien Lachance.	
FormID: 00035E02	Dark09RetirementFIN	GREETING	2	You must open these sealed orders immediately and follow their instructions to the letter. It would seem the Black Hand itself has a task for you.	
FormID: 00035E04	Dark09RetirementFIN	GREETING	0	Assassin! Why are you still here? Have you not opened your sealed orders? Go now! The Black Hand obviously has need of your abilities!

FormID: 00035E00	Dark09Retirement	GREETING	2	You also managed to leave Phillida's severed finger as a warning to his successor. Well done! Your bonus, 500 additional gold coins, is well earned.	
FormID: 00035E00	Dark09Retirement	GREETING	3	Go now. Get some rest. Sithis knows you've earned it. When you're ready for another contract, you need only ask.	
FormID: 00035E01	Dark09Retirement	GREETING	0	Adamus Phillida is dead! I could feel my heart swell with the Night Mother's love the moment that Imperial pig issued his last breath!

FormID: 00090AA9	Dark09Retirement	GREETING	0	Adamus Phillida has been a thorn in the Dark Brotherhood's side for far too long. Kill the pig, so Sithis can enslave his soul for all eternity!

FormID: 00035DF0	Dark08WhodunitFIN	GREETING	0	Greetings once more, assassin. When you're ready, I have a most important contract. One that has been sanctioned by the Black Hand itself.	
FormID: 00034894	Dark07Medicine	GREETING	0	Roderick may lie near death, but dead he is not. Until his soul has passed, our client -- and Sithis -- will not be satisfied.	
FormID: 00034895	Dark07Medicine	GREETING	0	Ah, so you infiltrated Fort Sutch, remained undetected, and replaced the medicine with the poison I provided. You are truly a master of shadow!	
FormID: 00034895	Dark07Medicine	GREETING	1	It pleases me greatly to offer you this reward, and a well-earned bonus. Go now. Rest. I'll have another contract ready whenever you are.	
FormID: 00034896	Dark07Medicine	GREETING	0	Roderick is dead, and Sithis is appeased. Unfortunately, the same is not true of the client who arranged this contract.	
FormID: 00034896	Dark07Medicine	GREETING	1	You were to avoid detection and kill Roderick by means of poison, yet you failed to follow these parameters. 	
FormID: 00034896	Dark07Medicine	GREETING	2	Here is your reward, minus any bonus. It would seem you and Gogron share a similar... style. Now go, and do be more careful in the future.

FormID: 00035586	MSShadowscale	GREETING	1	Let me guess, it was Ocheeva, right? No, wait. Teinaava. Yes, he put you up to this, didn't he. Ocheeva was always too busy to even be bothered.	
FormID: 00035586	MSShadowscale	GREETING	2	Well, you can kill me if you like. I'm afraid I won't make much of a challenge, though. The Argonian Royal Court already sent an Agent to do the job.	
FormID: 00035586	MSShadowscale	GREETING	3	He failed, of course. His body's around here somewhere. But he got in a pretty good hit. If I don't get some rest I'm probably dead anyway.	
FormID: 00035586	MSShadowscale	GREETING	4	So maybe I can appeal to your sense of good will, huh? Ha ha ha ha! You let me live, and I'll tell you where I stashed my treasure. Is it a deal?	
FormID: 00035587	MSShadowscale	GREETING	0	I need to rest now, regain my strength. Don't forget to take the heart of the Argonian Agent. Present that to Teinaava, and he'll be none the wiser.

FormID: 0005DD11	SE01Door	GREETING	0	Let's be civil, shall we? Please, have a seat.	
FormID: 0005E36F	SE01Door	GREETING	0	Well? Have you made up your mind? The tension is almost palpable.	;dry, condescending
FormID: 0007CF43	SE01Door	GREETING	0	Yes? Change of heart? Do tell.	;dry, condescending
FormID: 000133D6	SE01Door	GREETING	0	More questions? Astounding. Speak.	;dry, condescending
FormID: 00019D69	SE01Door	GREETING	0	Yes. What can I do for you? I imagine you're here about the door?	
FormID: 00081DBD	SE01Door	GREETING	0	Don't go back in there. I'm warning you. You'll end up like the others.	
FormID: 00081DBE	SE01Door	GREETING	0	Did you hear that? Did you? Voices from nowhere, madmen... where does it end? How did I get this posting?	
FormID: 000133D7	SE01Door	GREETING	0	I still say steer clear of that door. Nothing good to be found on the other side of it. Of that, I'm certain.	
FormID: 00071171	SE01Door	GREETING	0	Can't talk now. That door has been making noises again. No telling what's coming out.	
FormID: 000133DD	SE01Door	GREETING	0	I'd stay back from that door if I were you. Nothing that's gone in has come out right.	
FormID: 0001A11E	SE01Door	GREETING	0	No. Go away. I'm not here.	
FormID: 0001A11F	SE01Door	GREETING	0	Stay away! You don't know! You can't know! It's in there! It'll kill us all!	
FormID: 000139AA	SE07	GREETING	0	You're back! How nice for you. Does that mean you've made a decision? Or are you lost? Suicidal? Just let me know.	
FormID: 000139AB	SE07	GREETING	0	You haven't spoken to both Priests. You'll end up making a stupid decision, and you won't live to regret it. Don't do that.	
FormID: 0001365A	SE07	GREETING	0	You're talking to me. You should be talking to the Priests. You can't be doing both, can you? Neat trick if you could.	
FormID: 0001365B	SE07	GREETING	0	Aren't you off to a good start! That's important. For me. Really, your work is going to save me a lot of time.	
FormID: 0007893B	SE07	GREETING	0	How can I make your life easier? It's what I live for.	;doesn't mean it at all
FormID: 0007893C	SE07	GREETING	0	I don't think I can render any assistance until you hear Lord Sheogorath out. Do pay close attention.	
FormID: 00017967	SE08	GREETING	0	Your Grace, the situation is grim. Passwall is under attack. We are outmatched and outnumbered.	Gruff. Military.
FormID: 00017967	SE08	GREETING	1	Last night, as dusk fell, the spire at the center of town became active. Soon after, the area around it began to crystallize and change.	Gruff. Military. Somwhat confused by trying not to show it.
FormID: 00017967	SE08	GREETING	2	It wasn't long after that the Knights came.	Concerned.
FormID: 0001796F	SE08	GREETING	0	Your Grace, a dark time has been thrust upon us. Passwall is under attack. We are outmatched and outnumbered.	Gruff. Military.
FormID: 0001796F	SE08	GREETING	1	At first light, the spire at the center of town became active. Immediately, the area around it began to crystallize and change.	Gruff. Military. Somwhat confused by trying not to show it.
FormID: 0001796F	SE08	GREETING	2	Soon after that, the sky darkened and the knights came.	Gruff. Military. Somwhat confused by trying not to show it.
FormID: 00017968	SE08	GREETING	0	Are the Mazken prepared?	Short and curt. Expecting trouble.
FormID: 00017971	SE08	GREETING	0	Have you prepared the Aureals?	Short and curt. Expecting trouble.
FormID: 00017D53	SE08	GREETING	0	Were you able to provide the Mazken with aid? We have little in the way of supplies here. No healing. No restoration. 	A commander concerned for the survival of her troops.
FormID: 00017D53	SE08	GREETING	1	If you've done all that you can do, are you prepared for battle?	A commander concerned for the survival of her troops.
FormID: 00017970	SE08	GREETING	0	Have you provided the soldiers with aid? We have little in the way of supplies here. No healing. No restoration. 	A commander concerned for the survival of her troops.
FormID: 00017970	SE08	GREETING	1	If you have done all that you can, are you prepared to face the enemy?	A commander concerned for the survival of her troops.
FormID: 00018C76	SE08	GREETING	0	The enemy comes. Prepare yourself.	A commander on the eve of battle.
FormID: 0001796A	SE08	GREETING	0	The enemy comes. Prepare yourself.	A commander on the eve of battle.
FormID: 00017D54	SE08	GREETING	0	Victory is ours... for the moment.	Cautious optimism. She won the battle but doesn't expect to win the war.
FormID: 00017D54	SE08	GREETING	1	We must discuss our next move. The spire is obviously their source of power. This battle will not end until we find a way to shut it down.	Slightly optimistic after a long despair
FormID: 00017972	SE08	GREETING	0	Victory is ours... for the moment.	Cautious optimism. She won the battle but doesn't expect to win the war.
FormID: 00017972	SE08	GREETING	1	We must discuss our next move. The spire is obviously their source of power. This battle will not end until we find a way to shut it down.	Slightly optimistic after a long despair
FormID: 0001796B	SE08	GREETING	0	We will not be able to hold this position for long, Your Grace. 	Fatigued.
FormID: 00018C77	SE08	GREETING	0	With all due respect, the hour grows late and the situation grows darker. If we are to complete this plan, you must go now.	Annoyed and anxious, but showing respect.
FormID: 0001796C	SE08	GREETING	0	Your Grace! You... you're alive! Truly, you are the greatest warrior ever to hold the seat of Dementia! 	Shocked and pleased at the player's survival.
FormID: 0001796C	SE08	GREETING	1	I was certain that no one could survive the spire's collapse, but here you are! By the Staff, you are more than worthy to lead us.	Shocked and pleased at the player's survival.
FormID: 0001796C	SE08	GREETING	2	I fear that our work is not yet done. The area is still overrun with Knights that were not destroyed in the spire. 	Determined.
FormID: 0001796C	SE08	GREETING	3	You should return to the Palace and speak with Sheogorath. Ask him how he plans to defend this realm.	Angry that Sheogorath has the player fighting his battles for him.
FormID: 00017973	SE08	GREETING	0	I... I cannot believe it! You survived! We were certain that your light had been lost!	Shocked and pleased at the player's survival.
FormID: 00017973	SE08	GREETING	1	I apologize for doubting you, Your Grace. You are a most worthy leader, perhaps the greatest warrior to ever hold the Seat of Mania. 	Shocked and pleased at the player's survival.
FormID: 00017973	SE08	GREETING	2	But I fear that our work is not yet done. The area is still overrun with Knights that were not destroyed in the spire. 	Determined.
FormID: 00017973	SE08	GREETING	3	You should return to the Palace and speak with Sheogorath. Ask Him how He plans to defend this Realm.	Angry that Sheogorath has the player fighting his battles for him.
FormID: 0001796D	SE08	GREETING	0	The citizens of Passwall must begin to rebuild. Much has been lost, and I fear that this is only the beginning.	Determined.
FormID: 00017974	SE08	GREETING	0	Passwall must have a new dawn. The struggle will be great, but I have no doubt that we shall overcome this dark time.	Determined.
FormID: 00017976	SE08	GREETING	0	Your Grace! We didn't expect you here. Grakendo Udico is in command. You should speak with her.	Fatigued from battle. Surprised to see the player.
FormID: 0001797D	SE08	GREETING	0	Your Grace! We didn't expect you here. Aurig Desha is in command. You should speak with her.	Fatigued from battle. Surprised to see the player.
FormID: 00017D55	SE08	GREETING	0	Yes, Your Grace?	Fatigued from battle.
FormID: 0004136B	SE08	GREETING	0	What orders would you give me, Your Grace?	Fatigued from battle. Unsure about the player's ability to command.
FormID: 00018C78	SE08	GREETING	0	Yes, Your Grace?	Fatigued from battle.
FormID: 0001EB8E	SE08	GREETING	0	What orders would you give me, Your Grace?	Fatigued from battle. Unsure about the player's ability to command.
FormID: 00040B78	SE08	GREETING	0	The Knights are sure to attack again. 	Fatigued from battle. Unsure about the player's ability to command.
FormID: 00040B79	SE08	GREETING	0	We will keep fighting until the last of us is dead.	Fatigued from battle. Unsure about the player's ability to command.
FormID: 00017D97	SE08	GREETING	0	The battle is upon us. There is no time for conversation.	Shouting. Loud.
FormID: 00018C79	SE08	GREETING	0	The battle is upon us, this is no time for talk.	Shouting. Loud.
FormID: 0001EB98	SE08	GREETING	0	We've managed to slow them down this time.	Out of breath. Fatigued.
FormID: 0001EBC9	SE08	GREETING	0	We've lost so many...	Out of breath. Fatigued. Sad.
FormID: 00017983	SE08	GREETING	0	Perhaps this time we will have more than a few moment's rest.	Out of breath. Fatigued.
FormID: 0001EBE0	SE08	GREETING	0	Every time it gets quiet, they come back stronger and in greater numbers.	Out of breath. Fatigued. Frustrated.
FormID: 00017979	SE08	GREETING	0	Head to Xeddefen, Your Grace. By your will, we shall hold this position.	Hopeful.
FormID: 0001EBEB	SE08	GREETING	0	Xeddefen is the goal, Your Grace. We will hold the town as long as we can.	Determined.
FormID: 00017984	SE08	GREETING	0	Head to Xeddefen, Your Grace. We will hold this position.	Determined.
FormID: 0001EBEE	SE08	GREETING	0	May the light and your mother's grace guide you to Xeddefen and the means to topple this menace.	Hopeful. Inspired.
FormID: 0001EBF0	SE08	GREETING	0	You've survived! It... it cannot be!	Awestruck.
FormID: 0001EBF1	SE08	GREETING	0	Your Grace, I bend my knee to you. How you survived the collapse, I cannot imagine.	Awe struck. Stammering a bit.
FormID: 00017986	SE08	GREETING	0	You've survived! It is a miracle! Hail the warrior Duke of Mania!	Impressed.
FormID: 0001EBF2	SE08	GREETING	0	By the light, how did you make it out of there?	Shocked, amazed, awestruck.
FormID: 0001EBF3	SE08	GREETING	0	Only a true warrior could have accomplished this task. The Aureals shall sing your story for eons to come.	Shocked, amazed, awestruck.
FormID: 000181BB	SE08	GREETING	0	It's... it's you! I remember you. What are you doing down here? How did you get past the Knights?	Surprised, but releived.
FormID: 000181BB	SE08	GREETING	1	When they attacked, I ran from Passwall. They didn't say a word, they just started killing! The screams! By the staff, you can't imagine the screams!	Horrified and frightened, but still selfish.
FormID: 000181BB	SE08	GREETING	2	Felas and I slipped down here thinking that we'd be safe. But, no! We landed right in the middle of them!	Surprised, wants to escape but is frozen with fear.
FormID: 000181BB	SE08	GREETING	3	Felas ran off with them and left me to die! Me! That ingrate! Disloyal cur! Imagine, leaving me here all alone!	He cannot believe the nerve of someone who would leave him to die
FormID: 000181BC	SE08	GREETING	0	Can we get out of here?	Anxious.
FormID: 00043F3E	SE08	GREETING	0	I'm going to stay here and help rebuild this place. These fools need me.	Cocky and self assured. They'd get nowhere without him.
FormID: 00043F40	SE08	GREETING	0	Does Your Grace wish to be crushed to death, or do you merely find difficulty in locating the buttons and switches in these old ruins? 	Matter of fact.
FormID: 00043F40	SE08	GREETING	1	It seems only fair to warn Your Grace that those who came before often placed switches far from the door itself.	Matter of fact.
FormID: 00043F40	SE08	GREETING	2	For what purpose, we've never exactly been sure. 	Matter of fact.
FormID: 0008E3A2	SE08	GREETING	0	Uhm, Your Grace... now doesn't seem to be the best time for conversation. Perhaps your survival should take precedence at the moment.	Matter of fact.
FormID: 00081E43	SE08	GREETING	0	Are you having trouble with the Obelisks, Your Grace?	Matter of fact.
FormID: 00081E44	SE08	GREETING	0	It would seem that the Fringe has come under attack. The longer you wait to investigate, the harder it will be for you to do as you are told.	Matter of fact.
FormID: 00081E45	SE08	GREETING	0	It would seem that the forces of Order have moved very quickly.	Matter of fact.
FormID: 0001B081	SE08	GREETING	0	News of your success in the Fringe precedes you. To further cement the victory I have an important task for you to perform.	
FormID: 0001B081	SE08	GREETING	1	You will seek the assistance of Relmyna Verenim in Xaselm to rebuild the Gatekeeper. You remember the creature you killed to get in here? 	
FormID: 0001B081	SE08	GREETING	2	With the Gatekeeper restored and Xedilian in operation, we won't have to worry about anything getting in. Things already here are another matter.	
FormID: 0001B081	SE08	GREETING	3	You'll need to speak with Relmyna Verenim. She'll help you with your task. Strange woman. Has some unusual tastes.	
FormID: 0001B081	SE08	GREETING	4	With that done, the Fringe should be secure. For now. I can feel things start to get a little hairy. And, not in the good way, like on your head.	
FormID: 00019FC3	SE11a	GREETING	0	You wear our robes, but I hear the darkness that you bring in your very breath. You do not know harmony... you do not see my light.	Disgusted at the discovery of an intruder.
FormID: 00019FC3	SE11a	GREETING	1	You come to me glowing with violence and death. Your light has no place here. We seek harmony for ourselves and the Shivering Isles.	Disgusted at the discovery of an intruder.
FormID: 00016B57	SE11a	GREETING	0	How dare you interrupt me! 	Furious.
FormID: 00019FC4	SE11a	GREETING	0	Follow me! You are deserving to bear witness to Ciirta's destruction!	Triumphant.
FormID: 00016B59	SE11a	GREETING	0	Ciirta has fallen into darkness. Ra'kheran will lead the Apostles to the light!	Hopeful for the future with their new leader.
FormID: 0001A391	SE11a	GREETING	0	Ciirta is dead, and now the Apostles fear that there is no one to lead them to the light.	He is going somewhere with this
FormID: 0001A391	SE11a	GREETING	1	I should be the one who is leading, however. Do I have your support?	Devious.
FormID: 00019FC5	SE11a	GREETING	0	Have you brought to me the daggers?	Impatient
FormID: 00019FC6	SE11a	GREETING	0	Have you reconsidered my offer? Will you bring to me the daggers?	Very impatient and anxious.
FormID: 00016B58	SE11a	GREETING	0	You... you do not belong here. You are a stranger!	Surprised, but hopeful. He has a plan.
FormID: 00016B58	SE11a	GREETING	1	No! You do not understand! Put away your weapons, I mean you no violence. Perhaps you can help me.	Suddenly very worried about being killed. If he dies, he doesn't ge to be leader.
FormID: 0008F11F	SE11a	GREETING	0	You... you do not belong here. Quickly! Put on a robe before the others see you! They will kill you on sight!	Surprised, but hopeful. He has a plan.
FormID: 0008F11F	SE11a	GREETING	1	Please, I mean you no violence. Perhaps you can help me.	He has a plan.
FormID: 0007DEA0	SE11a	GREETING	0	Ciirta is dead, and Ra'kheran has fallen. Who will guide us now?	Lost and frightened of the future.
FormID: 00016B77	SE11a	GREETING	0	Ciirta is dead. Ra'kheran will guide us now.	They have trust in their new leader.
FormID: 00016B87	SE11a	GREETING	0	She has darkened... what will we do now?	
FormID: 0001A810	SE11a	GREETING	0	Greetings, friend. Have you come seeking the light?	
FormID: 00016B5B	SE11a	GREETING	0	Greetings, sister. How does the light find you this day?	
FormID: 0001A811	SE11a	GREETING	0	May the light shine upon your face!	
FormID: 00016B5A	SE11a	GREETING	0	Greetings, brother. How does the light find you this day?	
FormID: 0001443E	SE07A	GREETING	0	I will serve you well, Lord.	
FormID: 000206AD	SE07A	GREETING	0	So, the cycle begins anew and the Dutchess of Dementia has fallen.	
FormID: 000206AD	SE07A	GREETING	1	Just remember it was I that assisted you. I expect that will carry some favor under your rule.	
FormID: 00013FF8	SE07A	GREETING	0	What do you want now? I told you what I'm willing to do... now get away from me before someone hears us.	
FormID: 00013FF9	SE07A	GREETING	0	Ahhh, good to see you again.	Light sarcasm... stress on the LIGHT.
FormID: 0001443F	SE07A	GREETING	0	It is my honor to serve you.	
FormID: 000206B1	SE07A	GREETING	0	The... the lady Syl has fallen? Can this be?	
FormID: 000206B1	SE07A	GREETING	1	I admit I had my doubts about you, but something told me I was doing the right thing. Many thanks.	
FormID: 00013FFA	SE07A	GREETING	0	Don't be fooled, the Ritual isn't over.	
FormID: 00013FFA	SE07A	GREETING	1	The body on the bed isn't Syl, but merely an impersonator. The real Syl uses many such decoys to throw would-be killers off her trail.	
FormID: 00013FFA	SE07A	GREETING	2	Syl has made her escape through the hidden tunnel in the gardens outside her quarters! She must not get away!	
FormID: 00013FFA	SE07A	GREETING	3	Be wary, I fear that her escape may be a ruse to lure you into an ambush.	
FormID: 00013FFE	SE07A	GREETING	0	Please, I have done all I can. There is nothing more to say. Just be cautious.	
FormID: 00013A70	SE07A	GREETING	0	What is it you require?	
FormID: 0003160A	SE07A	GREETING	0	How can I be of service?	
FormID: 0007DBFE	SE07A	GREETING	0	Once again has the Ritual of Accession come full circle!	
FormID: 0007DBFE	SE07A	GREETING	1	The heart of Syl has been consumed by Arden-Sul's will, and the Demented welcome you with open arms.	
FormID: 0007DBFE	SE07A	GREETING	2	I now declare you to be Duchess of Dementia of the Shivering Isles! May your wrath and anger be your guide.	
FormID: 00014440	SE07A	GREETING	0	Once again has the Ritual of Accession come full circle!	
FormID: 00014440	SE07A	GREETING	1	The heart of Syl has been consumed by Arden-Sul's will, and the Demented welcome you with open arms.	
FormID: 00014440	SE07A	GREETING	2	I now declare you to be Duke of Dementia of the Shivering Isles! May your wrath and anger be your guide.	
FormID: 000206BA	SE07A	GREETING	0	Your task is nearly complete. All that's left is to touch the Altar and let Arden-Sul devour the Duchess' heart.	
FormID: 00014442	SE07A	GREETING	0	Wondering why I let him go, aren't you? I can see it in your face. Mostly in the eyes. I may take those from you when this is done.	
FormID: 00014442	SE07A	GREETING	1	This has never happened before! The ruler of Mania turning traitor? Unprecedented! But different is good. A new act in this play.	
FormID: 00014442	SE07A	GREETING	2	Maybe we're on to something here. We'll see how it plays out. It can't be worse than what's happened before.	
FormID: 00014443	SE07A	GREETING	0	You've done it! The Ritual is complete, and you've survived! Who'd have thought? Now, on to other...	
FormID: 00014449	SE07A	GREETING	0	You have things to do. Talking to me isn't one of them.	
FormID: 0003161B	SE07A	GREETING	0	You've made your choice and forsaken the name Arden-Sul. Please, leave me be.	
FormID: 0003161F	SE07A	GREETING	0	What? What is it? Very busy. Things to do. Or see. Or something.	
FormID: 0006A8B4	SE07A	GREETING	0	What can I do for you on this fine, fine day?	
FormID: 0009171F	SE07A	GREETING	0	Well done. I suppose you deserve your new post. Now, if only you stay alive long enough to enjoy it...	Sarcasm
FormID: 000917B4	SE07A	GREETING	0	Well? What are you waiting for? You have the heart, and the altar awaits.	Annoyed
FormID: 000917B6	SE07A	GREETING	0	Ugh. How messy. Well, now that you possess Syl's Heart, I'd make my way to the Sacellum as soon as possible.	
FormID: 000917B6	SE07A	GREETING	1	And do hurry, that heart is beginning to smell.	
FormID: 00091805	SE07A	GREETING	0	Do I have to spell it out for you? Apparently I do.	
FormID: 00091805	SE07A	GREETING	1	Syl has been slain. You need Syl's heart. I'll let you figure out the rest.	Annoyed
FormID: 0009187B	SE07A	GREETING	0	Now that you've found Syl's escape route I'd tread very carefully. She is the Mistress of Deception after all.	
FormID: 0009187B	SE07A	GREETING	1	If she means to escape, she'll do everything in her power to stop you.	Serious
FormID: 00091885	SE07A	GREETING	0	Kithlan seems eager to help you. When you become sovereign of Dementia, I'd keep him around.	
FormID: 00091885	SE07A	GREETING	1	So, you want to find the secret escape route? Easy enough.	
FormID: 00091885	SE07A	GREETING	2	I can't tell you exactly where it is. I wouldn't want your quest to be a [QUOTE]bust.[QUOTE]	Slight chuckle before last line.
FormID: 000918DC	SE07A	GREETING	0	Clever adversary isn't she? I bet your thinking that this was too easy, yes?	Pompus
FormID: 000918DC	SE07A	GREETING	1	Well, things aren't always as they seem. In fact, I think I hear the answer to your problem coming as we speak....	Say with an air of mystery
FormID: 000918FC	SE07A	GREETING	0	Confused already? Very disappointing.	Slightly scolding and sarcastic
FormID: 000918FC	SE07A	GREETING	1	If I were you, and thank Sheogorath that I'm not, I would begin with the people who spend their day closest to Syl.	
FormID: 0008E809	SE30	GREETING	0	You are not a member of the society. Watch if you must, but don't get in the way.	
FormID: 0007F44D	SE30	GREETING	0	Please leave! These are private moments!	A creepy, slow, sensual drawl. 
FormID: 0007F44E	SE30	GREETING	0	Visit me during store hours. These are private moments.	A creepy, slow, sensual drawl.

FormID: 00023E3C	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Welcome, dear Sister! So good to finally meet you! I hope you're getting along all right. If you need anything, anything at all, you need only ask.	
FormID: 00023E3E	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Hello, dearest Sister. Is there something I can help you with?	
FormID: 00023E3F	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Welcome, brother. So good to finally meet you. I hope you're getting along all right.	
FormID: 00023E51	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Yes, dearest Brother? Is there something I can help you with?	
FormID: 000251C0	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Yes? Is there something you need?	
FormID: 000251C3	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Why do you insist on annoying me?	
FormID: 000251C9	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Welcome! Welcome to the family! I'd hug you, but Ocheeva told me not to.	
FormID: 000251CB	Dark00General	GREETING	0	I know what you're thinking! Gogron, he's too big to be sneaky! Well you're right! Me, I like to just go in and hack my targets to pieces. Ha! 	REC -- mispronunciation -- should be [QUOTE]GOE-gron[QUOTE]
FormID: 000251D3	Dark00General	GREETING	0	You and I, we've got to stick together, eh? The others, they don't understand. Orcs may not be quiet, but can anyone kill as well as us? Never!	
FormID: 000251D4	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Yes, Brother? What can old Gogron do for you?	REC -- mispronunciation -- should be [QUOTE]GOE-gron[QUOTE]
FormID: 000251D5	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Yes, Sister? What can old Gogron do for you?	REC -- mispronunciation -- should be [QUOTE]GOE-gron[QUOTE]
FormID: 000251D6	Dark00General	GREETING	0	We are kin, yet I cannot help but despise you. Leave my sight, before I do something I regret.	
FormID: 000251D7	Dark00General	GREETING	0	You. What do you want?	
FormID: 000251D8	Dark00General	GREETING	0	I welcome you to our family, and this Sanctuary. May you find yourself at home here, in the loving embrace of our Lady the Night Mother.  	
FormID: 000251D9	Dark00General	GREETING	0	You are Argonian, yes, but you are no Shadowscale! What chaos you must have known as a hatchling! Thank Sithis you have come home at last. Welcome.	
FormID: 000251DA	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Ah, dear friend, may I steal a moment of your time? I have a rather delicate situation I was hoping you could help me with.	
FormID: 000251DA	Dark00General	GREETING	1	This is a personal matter, and will have no bearing on your standing within the Dark Brotherhood. Would you like to hear more?	
FormID: 00035588	Dark00General	GREETING	0	It's good to see you again! I hope your contracts have been giving you much pleasure.	
FormID: 000251DB	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Hello. What is it I can do for you?	
FormID: 000251DC	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Why do you bother me?	
FormID: 000251DD	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Warmest welcomes to you. I am Telaendril, Wood Elf and loyal daughter of Sithis. I hope you find our Sanctuary to your liking.	
FormID: 000251DE	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Hello, Brother. It's good to see you again. The Night Mother has been smiling upon you, I hope.	
FormID: 000251DF	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Hello, sweet Sister. It warms my heart to see you again. The Night Mother has been smiling upon you, I hope.	
FormID: 000251E0	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Hello, Brother. How can I help you?	
FormID: 000251E1	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Hello, Sister. Can I help you with something?	
FormID: 000251E2	Dark00General	GREETING	0	I find your very presence foul. Say what you will and then leave my sight!	
FormID: 000251E3	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Greetings, Brother. I do hope you are well.	
FormID: 000251E4	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Greetings, Sister. I do hope you are well.	
FormID: 000251FE	Dark00General	GREETING	0	If it isn't the newest member of the family. Let's get one thing straight -- the Tenets prevent me from killing you. But I don't have to like you.	
FormID: 000251FE	Dark00General	GREETING	1	I'll sell you equipment, but only because Ocheeva is making me. This family doesn't need any... outsiders.	
FormID: 000251FF	Dark00General	GREETING	0	You again? I thought I'd made it clear I'm not looking for a friend. If you're here to buy or sell something, get on with it already!	
FormID: 00092D79	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Ah, there you are! Look... I've been thinking, and... Well... I guess I just want to say I'm sorry for the way I've treated you in the past.         	
FormID: 00092D79	Dark00General	GREETING	1	I mean, look at you! The things you've accomplished! You've obviously proven yourself a valuable member of this Sanctuary.	
FormID: 00092D79	Dark00General	GREETING	2	So let's start over, shall we? I know from now on, you and I are going to be great friends! Now, is there something you'd like to buy or sell?	
FormID: 00092D7A	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Hey, there's my new pal! So what can I do for you? Need some items? Or maybe you're ready to unload something? Whatever you need!	
FormID: 00035597	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Ah, have you reconsidered my offer? Do you wish to eliminate that treasonous Shadowscale for me?	
FormID: 00035598	Dark00General	GREETING	0	You come speak with me, yet you do not bear Scar-Tail's heart. Please, you must slay that traitorous snake so Ocheeva and I can find peace!	
FormID: 00035599	Dark00General	GREETING	0	Ha! Yes! That is an Argonian heart, of that I am sure! You have slain Scar-Tail! Well done! Please, take these boots as payment for your services!	
FormID: 00035599	Dark00General	GREETING	1	They are called the Boots of Bloody Bounding, and carry a powerful enchantment. I'm sure you will find them most useful.	
FormID: 00025071	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	Hail. We got plenty of rooms if you want one.	
FormID: 00022506	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	We got plenty of rooms if you want one. Ain't nobody staying here these days 'cept old Rufio.	
FormID: 000224C5	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	I don't care how bad I need the business. You ain't welcome here. 	
FormID: 000224C6	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	Yeah, I still got rooms. What do you need?	
FormID: 000224C8	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	Hail, friend. Good to see you again. What can old Manheim help you with?	
FormID: 000224EA	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	Hello stranger. We don't get many visitors around here. Makes things pretty lonely for me, if you know what I mean.	
FormID: 000224F1	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	You make me sick! Now get out of here before I have Manheim throw you out!	
FormID: 000224F2	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	Still here, stranger? You're not actually renting a room, are you?	
FormID: 000224F3	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	It's good to see you, friend. This inn has been cheerless for far too long.	
FormID: 000224F4	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	I... I ain't got nothing to say! Now leave me be!	
FormID: 00023F33	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	Huh? You're not Gromm. Get out of my home! I don't want you here!	
FormID: 0002D923	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	The Master doesn't like visitors. Leave this house. Now. If you're still here in twenty seconds, I will be forced to crush you.	
FormID: 0004C05C	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	For your sake, you'd better be on your way to the door.	
FormID: 0007327B	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	Baenlin... Oh Baenlin... I loved ya, old man. I loved ya... But I couldn't protect ya... Oh Baenlin! Waaaahhhhh! [sobbing]	Drunk and depressed.
FormID: 0002F4D9	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	You... You're not the one Lachance was talking about! Please... Please, don't kill me! You can take anything you like, then just leave!	
FormID: 0002F4DA	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	Please, just take what you want and leave! I won't call the guards, I swear!	
FormID: 0002FF0A	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	Huh? Sorry... I ain't interested....	
FormID: 00036311	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	I'm sorry, but I'm really not one for engaging in conversation. Please, leave me.	
FormID: 0004918E	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	Beautiful, isn't she? The Marie Elena. Damn fine ship, with a damn fine crew. I should know, I'm her first mate. Malvulis is my name.	
FormID: 0004918E	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	1	So believe me when I tell you we don't like it when people snoop around in our affairs. You get near that ship, and my men will run you through.	
FormID: 0004918F	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	I hope I made myself clear the first time. If you get near that ship, you'll end up dead. Now get out of my face.	
FormID: 000493FB	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	I ain't got nothin' to say to you, fancy pants. So why don't you mind your own business, huh?	
FormID: 000661F5	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	I have no time for your pathetic attempts at small talk. Now walk away, before I get... nasty.	
FormID: 000661F6	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	No! You filthy guttersnipe! You won't get away with this! By Sithis, if I could only move my arms, I'd rip that smile right off your face!	Just been paralyzed. Can't move...but can still talk. He's pretty pissed, for obvious reasons.
FormID: 0007327C	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	Hmm? Oh, Caenlin's my name. Maybe you knew my uncle, Baenlin? He died recently. Stuffed head fell on him. Very tragic. Well, goodbye.                	 
FormID: 0007327D	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	Hmm? Oh, Caenlin's my name. Maybe you knew my uncle, Baenlin? He died recently. It was all very tragic. I'm heartbroken, of course. Well, goodbye.	 
FormID: 00071D4F	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	So I wanted somebody murdered! So I prayed to the Night Mother! What, is that a crime now? They even took my house, those bastards! Agghhh!    	
FormID: 000BE336	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	Sorry, no time to talk! I have to deliver these copies of the Black Horse Courier! Here, take a copy! It's free!	Traveling on a horse. Rushed.
FormID: 000BE337	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	Sorry, no time to talk! I have to deliver these copies of the Black Horse Courier! Have you heard of the Blackwood Company? Read all about them!	Traveling on a horse. Rushed.
FormID: 000BE338	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	Sorry, no time to talk! I have to deliver these copies of the Black Horse Courier! Here, have one of the latest editions, free as always!	Traveling on a horse. Rushed.
FormID: 000BE339	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	Sorry, no time to talk! I have to deliver these copies of the Black Horse Courier! Have the latest edition, free as always! It's about the Gray Fox!	Traveling on a horse. Rushed.
FormID: 000BE33A	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	Sorry, no time to talk! I have copies of the Black Horse Courier to deliver! Here's one of the latest! The Imperial Legion commander's been murdered!	Traveling on a horse. Rushed.
FormID: 000BE33B	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	Sorry, no time to talk! I have to deliver these copies of the Black Horse Courier! Here, have the latest edition! Some Elf in Bruma got killed!	Traveling on a horse. Rushed.
FormID: 000BE342	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	Sorry, no time to talk! I have to deliver these copies of the Black Horse Courier! Here, have a copy! The Night Mother rituals are on the rise!	Traveling on a horse. Rushed.
FormID: 000C45BB	Dark00GeneralNPC	GREETING	0	You need something... special? Check out my wares. You won't find this stuff at your local general store, that's for damn sure. 	sly
FormID: 0008B072	MS16B	GREETING	0	You have something to tell me about my father?	
FormID: 0008B077	MS16B	GREETING	0	Hello again.	
FormID: 0008B07A	MS16B	GREETING	0	What's new?	
FormID: 0008DA9B	MS16B	GREETING	0	Our business is done.	
FormID: 0008DAA2	MS16B	GREETING	0	You've made your choice... now leave me be.	
FormID: 0008DAA4	MS16B	GREETING	0	So... what have you brought me?	
FormID: 0008B07B	MS16B	GREETING	0	Look, I told you everything you need to know. Go to the cave, kill the ogres, get a reward. How hard is that?	
FormID: 00089930	MS16B	GREETING	0	I may have a bit of a proposition for you involving the Jemane family you so recently assisted.	
FormID: 0005A025	MS94	GREETING	0	Come on! We can use your help to drive back the invaders!	
FormID: 0005A026	MS94	GREETING	0	If you know how to close that Gate, be my guest. My orders are to hold this position, and that's what I intend to do.	
FormID: 0005A027	MS94	GREETING	0	Thanks for the help, friend. I didn't recognize you at first, but you're the Hero of Kvatch, aren't you?	
FormID: 0005A027	MS94	GREETING	1	It was a privilege to fight by your side.	
FormID: 0005A028	MS94	GREETING	0	Thanks for the help. As soon as my lieutenant gets back, we'll be moving out.	
FormID: 0005A029	MS94	GREETING	0	We were ordered out to attack the daedra coming out of that Oblivion Gate. Captain's the only one who ever knows what's going on.	
FormID: 0005A02A	MS94	GREETING	0	You went inside that Gate, huh? You saved our necks, so thanks.	
FormID: 0005A02A	MS94	GREETING	1	I was afraid we were gonna be ordered in there. Legion always ends up doing everybody's dirty work.	
FormID: 000715CF	MS10	GREETING	0	Move along, citizen. There's nothing to be done here.	
FormID: 0003C3B6	MS10	GREETING	0	I'm sorry, no one except for Cheydinhal City Guard are allowed inside this home.	
FormID: 0003C3B6	MS10	GREETING	1	Due to outstanding fines owed to the city, Aldos Othran's property has been seized and is now sealed until further notice. Good day.	
FormID: 0003C335	MS10	GREETING	0	Unless you relish the thought of decorating the end of my blade with your blood, I would get out of my sight.	
FormID: 0003C336	MS10	GREETING	0	Keep leading.	
FormID: 0003C2A1	MS10	GREETING	0	I don't like being disturbed.	
FormID: 0003C2A2	MS10	GREETING	0	Get out of my way before I have you slapped in irons.	
FormID: 0003C2A3	MS10	GREETING	0	Get outta my way, and keep followin'. I'll show ya a thing or two...	
FormID: 0003C2A4	MS10	GREETING	0	Who're you...?	
FormID: 0003C2A5	MS10	GREETING	0	Who... wha... are you... time is it? Hic.	
FormID: 00090E2F	MS10	GREETING	0	Yes? What news are you bringing me?	
FormID: 0003C339	MS10	GREETING	0	After speaking to the Count and reviewing your testimony, we decided to reduce Llevana's sentence as she was acting for self-preservation.	
FormID: 0003C339	MS10	GREETING	1	I've been promoted to the post of Captain of the Guard, and hope to return respect to the peacekeepers of this town.	
FormID: 0003C339	MS10	GREETING	2	The Count and I thank you for helping bring Ulrich's hold on Cheydinhal to an end, though we would have preferred having him brought up on charges.	REC Ulrich is pronounced [QUOTE]Ull-rick[QUOTE]
FormID: 0003C339	MS10	GREETING	3	As a token of our gratitude, as you did this at the risk of false imprisonment or perhaps your life, we reward you this bounty of gold.	
FormID: 0003C339	MS10	GREETING	4	On behalf of the people of Cheydinhal, I thank you.	
FormID: 0003C34A	MS10	GREETING	0	After speaking to the Count, and in light of the evidence you recovered, Ulrich has been removed from his post and arrested.	
FormID: 0003C34A	MS10	GREETING	1	Many guards are coming forward with more evidence of his greed, so it's safe to say he'll been spending quite a bit of time in the city dungeons.	
FormID: 0003C34A	MS10	GREETING	2	I've been promoted to the post of Captain of the Guard, and hope to return respect to the peacekeepers of this town.	
FormID: 0003C34A	MS10	GREETING	3	The Count and I thank you for helping bring Ulrich's hold on Cheydinhal to an end, and for doing so without unnecessary bloodshed.	REC Ulrich is pronounced [QUOTE]Ull-rick[QUOTE]
FormID: 0003C34A	MS10	GREETING	4	As a token of our gratitude, as you did this at the risk of false imprisonment or perhaps your life, we reward you this bounty of gold.	
FormID: 0003C34A	MS10	GREETING	5	On behalf of the people of Cheydinhal, I thank you.	
FormID: 0003C34B	MS10	GREETING	0	Like I said... meet me in two hours at the Cheydinhal Bridge Inn.	
FormID: 0003C34D	MS10	GREETING	0	You're back, good. Did you find the evidence?	
FormID: 0003C2A9	MS10	GREETING	0	We must put an end to this travesty of justice.	
FormID: 0003C2AD	MS10	GREETING	0	Have you discovered anything new?	
FormID: 0003C2AF	MS10	GREETING	0	What do you want?	
FormID: 0003C36F	MS10	GREETING	0	Seems you've made your choice. I suppose we'll have to do it your way. I don't know what else to say.	
FormID: 0003C370	MS10	GREETING	0	I have no regrets.	
FormID: 0003C378	MS10	GREETING	0	Stand back, and let me take care of this.	
FormID: 0003C2B3	MS10	GREETING	0	Well, where is he?	
FormID: 0003C2B6	MS10	GREETING	0	What's wrong?	
FormID: 0003C2BE	MS10	GREETING	0	I appreciate the interest you're taking in helping us with our situation.	
FormID: 0003C296	MS10	GREETING	0	You seem far too nice to be one of Ulrich's men. What can I do for you?	
FormID: 00037CE5	MS11	GREETING	0	Congratulations. I had a feeling you would catch on sooner or later. Leaving that journal behind was a stupid mistake on my part.	
FormID: 00037CE5	MS11	GREETING	1	I saw you enter Olav's Tap and Tack before I could get there, and I knew that I had to sneak out of Bruma somehow.	
FormID: 00037CE5	MS11	GREETING	2	It was only a matter of time before you or Carius figured it out. No matter. After I've killed you, I won't need my vampire hunter ruse any longer.	
FormID: 000919C4	MS11	GREETING	0	I'm sorry, there's nothing else you can assist with at this point.	
FormID: 00038AF2	MS11	GREETING	0	I see from your expression that you have grave news.	
FormID: 00038F1A	MS11	GREETING	0	You're back! What happened?	
FormID: 00038AF3	MS11	GREETING	0	What brings you to me this day?	
FormID: 00038AF5	MS11	GREETING	0	I see from your expression that you were successful.	
FormID: 0003857F	MS11	GREETING	0	No time to talk now, you must hurry to Boreal Stone Cave!	
FormID: 00038580	MS11	GREETING	0	Just before I arrived here, I received a report from one of our scouts watching the roads.	
FormID: 00038580	MS11	GREETING	1	Raynil was spotted heading west out of Bruma. The scout tried to follow, but lost him in the mountains.	
FormID: 00038580	MS11	GREETING	2	The only cave to the west that comes close to the one described in Gelebourne's journal is Boreal Stone Cave. That must be where he's headed.	
FormID: 00038580	MS11	GREETING	3	You must get there before he acquires whatever artifact is being kept there and makes his escape.	
FormID: 00038580	MS11	GREETING	4	I'm keeping the city guard in Bruma, as Raynil doesn't know we're after him. If he sees a guard, he may panic and run.	
FormID: 00038580	MS11	GREETING	5	You're my only hope at the moment. Please, you have my authorization to do everything you can to bring him to justice.	
FormID: 00038580	MS11	GREETING	6	If he won't surrender, I think you know what to do. Hurry, I fear you have a day at the most to stop him.	
FormID: 00038581	MS11	GREETING	0	I must go and tell the guard. Please, meet me at Olav's in one hour.	
FormID: 00038429	MS11	GREETING	0	So, any new revelations in your... errr.... investigation?	investigation should be said a bit sarcastically
FormID: 0003842C	MS11	GREETING	0	I'm going to make arrangements for removal of the bodies and then I'll probably stay on guard here for a bit.	
FormID: 0003842C	MS11	GREETING	1	We're afraid there may be retribution on Bradon's wife even though she had nothing to do with it. Vampires are a hated lot.	
FormID: 0003842D	MS11	GREETING	0	You're going to have to leave. This is a crime scene and no one other than ourselves or Raynil Dralas will be allowed access.	
FormID: 0003842F	MS11	GREETING	0	Sorry, I have a lot of work to do.	
FormID: 00038432	MS11	GREETING	0	This area is off limits to anyone except the Bruma City Watch.	
FormID: 000919C5	MS11	GREETING	0	Please, I'd like to be left alone.	
FormID: 00038AF7	MS11	GREETING	0	There isn't much more to say. I'm sorry.	
FormID: 00038AF8	MS11	GREETING	0	What news do you bring?	
FormID: 00038AFD	MS11	GREETING	0	It's so very nice to see you again.	
FormID: 00038B08	MS11	GREETING	0	Here is the amulet back. It's as beautiful as it was the day I remember seeing it long ago. I want you to keep it, as I have no use for this anymore.	
FormID: 00038B08	MS11	GREETING	1	I'm certain that's what I want, and I'm certain that's what Bradon would want.	
FormID: 00038B08	MS11	GREETING	2	I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I hope that the amulet helps keep you safe on whatever roads you may travel.	
FormID: 00038AFF	MS11	GREETING	0	What news do you bring?	
FormID: 0003858A	MS11	GREETING	0	What is it?	
FormID: 00038434	MS11	GREETING	0	Do you have any more questions? I'm afraid I know little more.	
FormID: 00038435	MS11	GREETING	0	I can't believe this is happening.	
FormID: 00038435	MS11	GREETING	1	Please... please. I need your help. My husband was no vampire! It's ridiculous! No one will listen to me!	
FormID: 00038437	MS11	GREETING	0	I... I'm sorry... I can't right now.	
FormID: 000919C7	MS11	GREETING	0	If you want a room or a drink, I'm your man. Otherwise, I got nothing to say to you.	
FormID: 00038B01	MS11	GREETING	0	It's very good to see you again.	
FormID: 0003843B	MS11	GREETING	0	Anything else I can help with, you just let me know.	
FormID: 0003844A	MS11	GREETING	0	What can I do for you today?	
FormID: 00089977	MSMisc	GREETING	0	Can't you see I have things to do? Now please... get out of my way.	
FormID: 00089978	MSMisc	GREETING	0	As the newest member of the Knights of the Thorn, I bid you welcome!	
FormID: 000314F4	MS51	GREETING	0	Hello. I'm not really in the mood to chat right now.	
FormID: 0015974A	MS51	GREETING	0	It is quite nice to see you again. I hope you are faring well.	typo correction
FormID: 000314F7	MS51	GREETING	0	Ahhh! You have returned from your investigation, and I am eager to hear the results.	
FormID: 000314F7	MS51	GREETING	1	Whom did you accuse?	
FormID: 000314F8	MS51	GREETING	0	I hope the investigation goes well. Return to me when you have found the culprit. 	
FormID: 0003565D	MS51	GREETING	0	Good to see you again. Have you reconsidered your decision to undertake the investigation?	
FormID: 000314F9	MS51	GREETING	0	It is a pleasure to meet you. I am Countess Valga of Chorrol. I wish I had time to chat, but I'm afraid I am in the middle of an investigation.	
FormID: 000314FC	MS51	GREETING	0	Words cannot to do justice for the joy I feel... many blessings upon you, my friend. I do not have much, but I wish to reward such valor.	
FormID: 000314FC	MS51	GREETING	1	Return to me in three weeks, and I'll have a special painting for you. It is the least I can do for you.	
FormID: 000314FD	MS51	GREETING	0	It is with the warmest regards I welcome you again, my friend. But you have returned a bit too early. I should have the painting done soon.	
FormID: 000314FE	MS51	GREETING	0	I understand the decision that you have made. And I accept my fate. Now please leave me to my thoughts.	
FormID: 0000365C	MS51	GREETING	0	Hello. Are you searching for something?	
FormID: 000314FF	MS51	GREETING	0	Hello again. I hope your search for the painting goes well.	
FormID: 00031504	MS51	GREETING	0	Welcome to Chorrol Castle. I am Chanel, the court mage. What brings you to me today?	
FormID: 0003150C	MS51	GREETING	0	I suppose I should be happy to see you again. I'm not.	
FormID: 000038A7	MS51	GREETING	0	So? You a living statue or are you gonna say something?	
FormID: 0003150D	MS51	GREETING	0	Oh. It's Valga's errand boy! How goes the 'big important investigation'?	
FormID: 0003152B	MS51	GREETING	0	What do you want?	
FormID: 0015974B	MS51	GREETING	0	Hello. I am Laythe Wavrick, the Chief Herald and Countess Valga's attendant. Welcome to Chorrol.	
FormID: 000038D2	MS51	GREETING	0	A pleasure to meet you again.	
FormID: 000038D3	MS51	GREETING	0	Yes?	
FormID: 00089938	MS48	GREETING	0	Quickly, quickly! There's no time!	
FormID: 00089938	MS48	GREETING	1	You must get to the top of the large tower. The Sigil Keep, they call it. That's what keeps the Oblivion Gate open!	
FormID: 00089938	MS48	GREETING	2	Find the Sigil Stone. Remove it, and the Gate will close! Hurry! The Keeper has the key-- you must get the key!	
FormID: 00089936	MS48	GREETING	0	Take the key. Get to the Sigil Keep, and find the Sigil Stone. It's the only way.	
FormID: 00089936	MS48	GREETING	1	Don't worry about me; there's no time! Get moving!	
FormID: 00089937	MS48	GREETING	0	Have you got the key? You must get the Keeper's key -- it's the only way into the Sigil Keep!	
FormID: 0009811B	MS48	GREETING	0	Get out of here! There's no time for this!	
FormID: 0009811C	MS48	GREETING	0	Thank the Nine! I never thought I'd see another friendly face...	
FormID: 0009811C	MS48	GREETING	1	The others... taken... they were taken to the tower!	
FormID: 001778CA	MS48	GREETING	0	This just keeps getting better and better. What do you want me to do?	
FormID: 0017C45C	MS48	GREETING	0	What's the plan?	
FormID: 00032D3D	MS48	GREETING	0	Come on! Run while there's still time! The Guard still holds the road, but it's only a matter of time before they're overwhelmed!	
FormID: 0001E8D1	MS48	GREETING	0	Have you brought help? We've been trapped here since the daedra overran the city.	
FormID: 0008DFD5	MS48	GREETING	0	How did you get in here? What are you doing here?	
FormID: 00028861	MS48	GREETING	0	Excuse me. I need to take these people to the encampment.	
FormID: 00024828	MS48	GREETING	0	The area is clear? Then as soon as Captain Matius gives the order, I'll escort the civilians to safety.	REC: MATT-ius
FormID: 00028862	MS48	GREETING	0	I knew Captain Matius would get us through this. He'd be up for a commendation, if anyone were left to issue it.	REC: MATT-ius
FormID: 0002875C	MS48	GREETING	0	This is our one chance -- don't screw it up for us.	
FormID: 00028863	MS48	GREETING	0	I didn't expect any of us to live this long. Maybe we're not doomed, after all.	
FormID: 00028719	MS48	GREETING	0	Don't talk - fight!	
FormID: 00028558	MS48	GREETING	0	The city's in flames, and we've got nothing but a bunch of greenhorns. I doubt the situation could be much worse.	
FormID: 00028864	MS48	GREETING	0	We... we did it? And I'm still in one piece! I mean, of course we did it. I never doubted us for a second.	
FormID: 0002871A	MS48	GREETING	0	If we make it through this alive, I'll be amazed.	
FormID: 0002855A	MS48	GREETING	0	Savlian's not really the captain, you know. We're just following him because he's the highest ranking officer left alive.	
FormID: 00028557	MS48	GREETING	0	Talk to Captain Matius if you need something. I'm just following his orders.	REC: MATT-ias
FormID: 0002871B	MS48	GREETING	0	Just follow Savlian's orders, and everything will be fine.	REC:   SAHV-lian
FormID: 0006B1B3	MS48	GREETING	0	What's it like out there? We were beginning to fear we were the only survivors.	
FormID: 00028559	MS48	GREETING	0	A whole city, just.... lost. How did we let this happen?	
FormID: 00024851	MS48	GREETING	0	Ha ha! We wiped the bastards out!	
FormID: 00024851	MS48	GREETING	1	It's safe to pull those people out of the chapel. Let's get in there and make sure they're all right.	
FormID: 00024851	MS48	GREETING	2	Come on. This is only the beginning of the battle for Kvatch. We can discuss the next phase once the civilians are safe.	
FormID: 00024840	MS48	GREETING	0	Let's get inside the chapel and make sure those folks are all right. If there are injuries, they'll need to be tended to right away.	
FormID: 00028865	MS48	GREETING	0	We've done it! I can't believe it -- I didn't really think this would work. Maybe we do have a fighting chance.	
FormID: 00028865	MS48	GREETING	1	Oh, yes. We're not done. Not even close. This was only the first step. If this town is to be ours again, we'll need to get inside the castle.	
FormID: 00028865	MS48	GREETING	2	You've come this far with us; will you go further? If we're truly going to succeed, I'll need much more of your help.	
FormID: 00028865	MS48	GREETING	3	I warn you though, what we've seen so far is nothing compared to the battle that likely awaits us.	REC
FormID: 00028865	MS48	GREETING	4	Take a few moments to catch your breath and think it over. When you're ready, let me know, and we'll get underway. 	
FormID: 00028003	MS48	GREETING	0	We've got to clear this area so we can pull those people out of the chapel! Kill anything that moves!	
FormID: 0006B1B4	MS48	GREETING	0	Follow me! For Kvatch!	in dialogue with player, but bracing for battle
FormID: 0001E8A7	MS48	GREETING	0	You closed the Gate? I knew you could do it! This is our chance to launch a counterattack!	
FormID: 0001E8A7	MS48	GREETING	1	I need you to come with us. You've got far more combat experience than these men.	
FormID: 0001E8A7	MS48	GREETING	2	Are you able to join us now? I can wait, but not for long. We've got to move quickly, before they have a chance to barricade the city gate.	
FormID: 00028004	MS48	GREETING	0	Are you ready? We need to move out soon, while we still have a chance to strike.	
FormID: 0017C45D	MS48	GREETING	0	Until you find a way to close that Oblivion Gate, there's nothing I can do but try to hold our position here as long as I can.	
FormID: 0001E8A8	MS48	GREETING	0	Have you changed your mind? I don't think they've barricaded the gates yet, so we still have a chance to attack the city.	
FormID: 0001E8DE	MS48	GREETING	0	While that infernal Oblivion Gate still stands, I don't dare leave the camp undefended. Are you willing to try and close it?	
FormID: 00024853	MS48	GREETING	0	Stand back, civilian!	
FormID: 00024853	MS48	GREETING	1	This is no place for you. Get back to the encampment at once!	
FormID: 0017C45E	MS48	GREETING	0	You'd best get back to the encampment. There's no telling when more of them will come out of that infernal Oblivion Gate.	
FormID: 00098145	MS48	GREETING	0	You should not be here, mortal. Your blood is forfeit, your flesh is mine!	
FormID: 00033EE0	MS46FIN	GREETING	0	You've given me new hope, friend. I really believe we can make Cropsford a home for ourselves.	
FormID: 00033EE1	MS46FIN	GREETING	0	What do you think, friend? We've accomplished a lot since you last saw this place.	
FormID: 00033EE3	MS46FIN	GREETING	0	I'm proud of what we've built here. You should be, too. Cropsford wouldn't exist without the help you gave us.	
FormID: 00033EE4	MS46FIN	GREETING	0	Hey, I was up in Cropsford the other day. It looks like they're really making a go of it. You did a good thing there, you know.	
FormID: 000319CB	MS46	GREETING	0	Hello my friend. A word of advice. Watch for goblins if you're heading north.	
FormID: 000319CC	MS46	GREETING	0	What brings you into this goblin-infested wilderness, stranger?	
FormID: 00033EE2	MS46	GREETING	0	Hello. I hope the goblins along the Yellow Road didn't give you any trouble.	
FormID: 00033EF2	MS46	GREETING	0	Welcome, traveller. We're all so worried about the goblins, we may not be as hospitable as we should be.	
FormID: 0002F476	MS46	GREETING	0	Let me know as soon as Cropsford is cleared of goblins, so we can get back to building our new settlement.	
FormID: 00033EF3	MS46	GREETING	0	If you need anything, talk to my father-in-law. This whole expedition was his idea.	
FormID: 00033EF4	MS46	GREETING	0	If it's about Cropsford, please talk to my father. He'll know what to do.	
FormID: 000319CD	MS46	GREETING	0	Well met! Come, warm yourself by our fire.	
FormID: 00028693	MS45	GREETING	0	What should I do?	
FormID: 0002809B	MS45	GREETING	0	Please, let me out of here! You must help me escape. I think these creatures plan to do something horrible to me tonight!	
FormID: 0002809C	MS45	GREETING	0	Hello, I don't think we've met.  Are you new in town?	
FormID: 000280C5	MS45	GREETING	0	I'm don't mean to impose, but I'm hoping you can help me.  My daughter, Dar-Ma is missing and I don't know what to do.  	
FormID: 00017786	MS45	GREETING	0	What are you doing? We can't talk in front of him!	in a scared whisper
FormID: 00017787	MS45	GREETING	0	You came. Good. I don't have much time. I have to get to the Gathering before I'm missed.	
FormID: 000A2E56	MS45	GREETING	0	I can't be seen talking to you. I've done what I can. Now it's up to you.	
FormID: 00028211	MS45	GREETING	0	Let me give you some advice, stranger.  Leave.  Now.  You ain't welcome here.	
FormID: 0002873C	MS45	GREETING	0	You're not welcome around here.	
FormID: 00028212	MS45	GREETING	0	We don't like strangers poking their noses into our business.	
FormID: 00028213	MS45	GREETING	0	If you're not careful, the brethren will have to teach you a lesson.	
FormID: 0001DCB9	MS38	GREETING	0	A little bird told me that you've been asking around town about Glarthir. Our resident [QUOTE]eccentric.[QUOTE] I'd like to know why.	
FormID: 0001DC28	MS38	GREETING	0	Ah, you came. You're sure you weren't followed? Good, I thought I could trust you. Nobody else in town. They're all in on it ... all watching me.	crazed ramblings
FormID: 0001DC28	MS38	GREETING	1	Well.  Yes.  I need you to do something for me.  I'll pay you -- gold.  You like gold, don't you?  Lots of gold.	more crazed ramblings
FormID: 0001DC28	MS38	GREETING	2	Here's my problem. I'm being followed. Watched. Marukhati Selectives, maybe. Not sure. I'm a threat, you see? To their plans. I know too much.	
FormID: 0001DC28	MS38	GREETING	3	I need you to check out some people for me, the ones that are following me.  Watch them, see where they go, who they report to. Will you help me?	
FormID: 0001DCC6	MS38	GREETING	0	So, you saw Bernadette Peneles, did you?  She WAS watching me and following me, wasn't she?	
FormID: 0001DC29	MS38	GREETING	0	Tell me what you learned about Toutius Sextius.	
FormID: 0002366D	MS38	GREETING	0	So, what did you discover about the upstanding Davide Surilie?	dripping with sarcasm
FormID: 00023675	MS38	GREETING	0	Have you... done... what I asked?	nervous, almost panicking
FormID: 0001DC2B	MS38	GREETING	0	You said you wanted me to solve this myself. And I am. Drastic measures. Didn't want to, but you're right, it is the only way.	In a whispered undertone
FormID: 0001DC2B	MS38	GREETING	1	Um, no, I don't know the way to the Imperial City.  You'll have to ask someone else.	In a loud, artificial voice
FormID: 0001DC2C	MS38	GREETING	0	You fool!  You'll ruin everything!  We can't be seen talking together!	In a whispered undertone
FormID: 0001DC2C	MS38	GREETING	1	Um, no, I don't know the way to the Imperial City.  You'll have to ask someone else.	In a loud, artificial voice
FormID: 00000923	MS38	GREETING	0	We can't be seen talking!  I waited for you last night behind the Great Chapel, where WERE you?!  I'll meet you there tonight.	In a whispered undertone
FormID: 00000923	MS38	GREETING	1	Yes, the Gold Road does pass through Skingrad.  I, too, find it fascinating.	In a loud, artificial voice
FormID: 00000921	MS38	GREETING	0	I told you not to speak to me in public! We'll meet tonight, at the place we discussed.	In a whispered undertone
FormID: 00000921	MS38	GREETING	1	Ah, sorry, I have no idea what time it is.	In a loud, artificial voice
FormID: 00026BAF	MS37	GREETING	0	Have you spoken to S'drassa yet? I hear she eagerly awaits your return.	
FormID: 00022E51	MS37	GREETING	0	Anything else I can help with?	
FormID: 00022E52	MS37	GREETING	0	What can I help you with?	
FormID: 00022F0F	MS37	GREETING	0	You look like you've seen some travel.	
FormID: 00026BC3	MS37	GREETING	0	May I help with any last minute preparations?	
FormID: 00026BBE	MS37	GREETING	0	What did you learn from [QUOTE]Knightfall[QUOTE]?	
FormID: 00022F10	MS37	GREETING	0	I hope the book helps you find where Garridan may have fallen.	
FormID: 00022F12	MS37	GREETING	0	I just knew that Julienne would have more information.	
FormID: 00022E53	MS37	GREETING	0	I suggest you make your way to the Imperial City. Can't make money by standing here.	
FormID: 00022E57	MS37	GREETING	0	I'd love to have the Tears added to my collection.	
FormID: 00022E59	MS37	GREETING	0	Have you reconsidered?	
FormID: 00022E5C	MS37	GREETING	0	S'Drassa of the Mages Guild, Evoker and Alchemist. And also, in his scant free time, a Trainer in Alchemy.	
FormID: 00022E5C	MS37	GREETING	1	But... perhaps you are an adventurer? Could you assist me in acquiring something for my crystal collection?	
FormID: 00047767	MS37	GREETING	0	Excuse me. Perhaps you're an adventurer? Could you assist me in acquiring something for my crystal collection?	
FormID: 0000C1BC	MS31	GREETING	0	I honestly don't know how to repay you. I'm not a wealthy man by any means, but perhaps I could assist you in other ways.	
FormID: 0000C1BD	MS31	GREETING	0	You're awake.... good. I didn't want to disturb you. I suppose you're wondering what I did with Selene?	
FormID: 0000C1BD	MS31	GREETING	1	The authorities at the Imperial City took her off the ship as soon as we docked. I was also informed that there was a reward for her capture.	
FormID: 0000C1BD	MS31	GREETING	2	Here you go. Don't spend it all in one place... unless it's here of course!	
FormID: 0000C1BE	MS31	GREETING	0	I suggest you rest in your room until we arrive back at the Imperial City. Graman should have us underway soon.	
FormID: 0000C1BF	MS31	GREETING	0	Oh thank goodness! That horrid woman kept threatening me! She said if I didn't come up with the loot she'd throw me to the slaughterfish.	
FormID: 00015717	MS31	GREETING	0	Now that Selene is locked up safely below, I think we can all breathe a little easier. I can't thank you enough.	
FormID: 0000C1C0	MS31	GREETING	0	I don't wish to get underway until Selene is safely locked in a room on the inn deck.	
FormID: 0000C1C1	MS31	GREETING	0	Thank goodness you arrived when you did! I feared that I'd be thrown to the slaughterfish.	
FormID: 000148CE	MS31	GREETING	0	I... can't speak to you... talk to her...	
FormID: 0018885C	MS31	GREETING	0	Well met. Welcome to the Bloated Float. She's the finest inn on the water in all Cyrodiil.	
FormID: 0018885D	MS31	GREETING	0	Hello.	
FormID: 0000C1C4	MS31	GREETING	0	Thanks again for helping us. I'm sure Ormil will reward you appropriately.	
FormID: 0000C1C5	MS31	GREETING	0	I'm sure Ormil can help you now. I'm busy trying to get us home.	
FormID: 0000C1C6	MS31	GREETING	0	Like I said, I'm not moving the Float until Ormil is safe.	
FormID: 0000C1C7	MS31	GREETING	0	Sounds like the coast is clear, so I'll make my way up to the ship's wheel. But I'm not moving this hulk an inch until Ormil is safe.	
FormID: 0000C1C9	MS31	GREETING	0	I'll wait on the tavern deck until you clear the top deck. That's where the ship's wheel is located.	
FormID: 0000C1D3	MS31	GREETING	0	I'm not going to the top deck until it's safe.	
FormID: 0000C1DC	MS31	GREETING	0	Thank you for freeing me. I'm Graman gro-Marad, the Bloated Float's bouncer and helmsman. I've been locked in that storage room for hours.	
FormID: 0000C1DC	MS31	GREETING	1	I don't know exactly what's going on, but not long ago, a gang of thieves calling themselves The Blackwater Brigands stormed the ship.	
FormID: 0000C1DC	MS31	GREETING	2	They took myself and Ormil, the Float's owner, hostage and put the ship to sea. I have no idea what they're after.	
FormID: 0000C1DC	MS31	GREETING	3	If you can get me safely to the top deck, I can steer the Float home. But I'm not budging until the coast is clear.	
FormID: 0000C1DC	MS31	GREETING	4	I'm used to dealing with drunken louts, not a gang of well-armed thieves.	
FormID: 0000C1DE	MS31	GREETING	0	I'll wait here until the tavern deck is clear.	
FormID: 00188860	MS31	GREETING	0	Move outta' my way.	
FormID: 0000C202	MS31	GREETING	0	I've nothing more to say to you.	
FormID: 0000C203	MS31	GREETING	0	I've already surrendered. What more do you want?	
FormID: 0000C1EA	MS31	GREETING	0	How'd you get in here?	
FormID: 00015256	MS31	GREETING	0	Wha- ? What are you doing up here? They find the Golden Galleon yet?	
FormID: 00015257	MS31	GREETING	0	Ho there! Where do you think you're going! Selene's not going to like this one bit... I wasn't to be disturbed!	
FormID: 000151E5	MS31	GREETING	0	Hey! Who in Oblivion are you? You don't look like one of the Blackwater Brigands!	
FormID: 0001D037	MS29	GREETING	0	I had a feeling you'd catch on sooner or later. That's why I had this trap prepared for you. If you'll notice, the grave is already dug.	
FormID: 0001D037	MS29	GREETING	1	This time, it wasn't to take something away from the graveyard, it was to add something. I'm afraid all I can offer you is an unmarked grave.	
FormID: 0001D039	MS29	GREETING	0	Yeah?	
FormID: 0001E7C0	MS29	GREETING	0	It is good to see you again. 	
FormID: 0001E7C9	MS29	GREETING	0	Were you able to stop Agarmir?	
FormID: 0001D03F	MS29	GREETING	0	Welcome back.	
FormID: 0001E7CE	MS29	GREETING	0	Why are you following me? Please... go away. I'm quite busy.	
FormID: 0000B2B9	MS29	GREETING	0	What kind of deal can I make for you today?	
FormID: 0000B2DA	MS29	GREETING	0	I have been anxiously awaiting your return.	
FormID: 0000B2DB	MS29	GREETING	0	Any news about that certain task we discussed?	
FormID: 0001671C	MS29	GREETING	0	Feel free to browse, friend. It's nice to see a new shopper. I was afraid I lost any hope of new business ever since Thoronir opened up.	
FormID: 0000B5AB	MS29	GREETING	0	Feel free to browse, friend.	
FormID: 00095A88	MS29	GREETING	0	Good day to you.

FormID: 00031E9F	MS13	GREETING	0	Thank you for getting me out of that cursed place. 'Tis ashame Farwil didn't make it. At least he died doing what he loved.	
FormID: 00031EB2	MS13	GREETING	0	Thank you for getting me out of that cursed place.	
FormID: 0003357F	MS13	GREETING	0	Ah! Cheydinhal... it's good to see its walls again.	
FormID: 00033580	MS13	GREETING	0	All this, and now Farwil is dead. Oblivion is truly cursed. Make sure you take his signet ring to bring to the Count. He would want proof.	
FormID: 00031EB3	MS13	GREETING	0	Even if Farwil doesn't say it, we appreciate that you're here.	
FormID: 0003337B	MS13	GREETING	0	It's good to see a friendly face. I feared we'd never see anyone from Cyrodiil again.	
FormID: 0003337B	MS13	GREETING	1	I know you must have many questions... speak with Farwil and he'll answer them for you.	
FormID: 0002D3A1	MS13	GREETING	0	I'm pleased to finally meet the savior of Cheydinhal. And although the death of Farwil saddens me, I know you did the best you could.	
FormID: 0002D3A1	MS13	GREETING	1	I realize he was trying at times, and he spoke before he thought, but he was still my son, and I adored him greatly.	
FormID: 0002D3A1	MS13	GREETING	2	I'm sure he was difficult to travel with, and I respect your patience. Whereas others would have left him to die, I'm sure you fought at his side.	
FormID: 0002D3A1	MS13	GREETING	3	Your actions are duly noted, and your reward will be in gold.	
FormID: 0002DF70	MS13	GREETING	0	I'm pleased to finally meet the savior of Cheydinhal. I'm also overjoyed that you saved my son's life.	
FormID: 0002DF70	MS13	GREETING	1	I realize he's trying at times, and he speaks before he thinks, but he's still my son, and I adore him greatly.	
FormID: 0002DF70	MS13	GREETING	2	I'm sure he was difficult to travel with, and I respect your patience. Most would have given him up for dead rather than deal with his ego.	
FormID: 0002DF70	MS13	GREETING	3	Anyway, I digress. I'm sure you wish to hear of your reward.	
FormID: 0002DF70	MS13	GREETING	4	I'm in possession of two fine weapons. They're both heirlooms of the Indarys family, held in the Castle for several generations.	
FormID: 0002DF70	MS13	GREETING	5	I'd take great pleasure in bestowing one of them upon you. Please, choose the Thornblade or the Staff of Indarys.	
FormID: 00032DFA	MS13	GREETING	0	Please. Although I'm concerned about the safe return of my son and the closing of the gate, please see Amminus Gregori for all of the details.	
FormID: 00032DFA	MS13	GREETING	1	With a possible attack looming, I must be free to make preparations. Good luck.	
FormID: 000579E2	MS13	GREETING	0	I don't have time to chat right now. With that Oblivion Gate looming outside the city walls, we're bracing for an attack. Perhaps we can speak later.	
FormID: 0002E4B1	MS13	GREETING	0	Why are you still here? You're supposed to go speak with my father!	
FormID: 00031EBA	MS13	GREETING	0	We made it!... errr, I mean... victory is ours once again! Huzzah! It's a shame that Bremman didn't make it though. He was a good knight.	
FormID: 00031EBA	MS13	GREETING	1	You've done well. I wouldn't have expected such bravery from someone who isn't a Knight of the Thorn.	
FormID: 00031EBA	MS13	GREETING	2	Now that this battle between good and evil has been won, and the day is ours, you should go speak with my father.	
FormID: 00031EBA	MS13	GREETING	3	He will reward you greatly for escorting me home and closing the Oblivion Gate.	
FormID: 00031EBA	MS13	GREETING	4	Since you have led us to victory, I am hereby giving you the honorary title of a Knight of the Thorn.	
FormID: 00031EBA	MS13	GREETING	5	Your name shall be revered and your deeds placed into song to be performed by the greatest bards for generations to come. Congratulations!	
FormID: 0002E71E	MS13	GREETING	0	We made it!... errr, I mean... victory is ours once again! Huzzah!	
FormID: 0002E71E	MS13	GREETING	1	You've done well. I wouldn't have expected such bravery from someone who isn't a Knight of the Thorn.	
FormID: 0002E71E	MS13	GREETING	2	Now that this battle between good and evil has been won, and the day is ours, you should go speak with my father.	
FormID: 0002E71E	MS13	GREETING	3	He will reward you greatly for escorting me home and closing the Oblivion Gate.	
FormID: 0002E71E	MS13	GREETING	4	Since you have led us to victory, I am hereby giving you the honorary title of a Knight of the Thorn.	
FormID: 0002E71E	MS13	GREETING	5	Your name shall be revered and your deeds placed into song to be performed by the greatest bards for generations to come. Congratulations!	
FormID: 0002E71F	MS13	GREETING	0	Lead on... to victory for the Knights of the Thorn! Oh, and you too of course.	
FormID: 0002E723	MS13	GREETING	0	It's about time someone got here. What took you so long?	
FormID: 000A3840	MS13	GREETING	0	It's about time someone got here. What took you so long?	
FormID: 0002E725	MS13	GREETING	0	I'm sorry, I have to patrol the area... but you should hurry to Castle Cheydinhal. The Count doesn't like to be kept waiting.	
FormID: 0002F4FB	MS13	GREETING	0	You've done it! But what of Farwil?	
FormID: 0003358C	MS13	GREETING	0	You've done it! I never thought it possible!	
FormID: 0003358C	MS13	GREETING	1	 I suppose Farwil will wish to talk to you now. Musn't keep the Count's son waiting.	
FormID: 0002FC38	MS13	GREETING	0	You're a brave soul to attempt entry to Oblivion. Hopefully, your skill matches your fortitude.	
FormID: 0002FC3A	MS13	GREETING	0	Be glad to answer any other questions. Just keep your voice down, who knows what could slip out of that gate at any moment.	
FormID: 00030574	MS13	GREETING	0	I'd advise you to keep your distance from that accursed portal.	
FormID: 00032DFB	MS13	GREETING	0	Good work closing the Oblivion Gate, you've made my job much easier and safer. Thanks!	
FormID: 0003359E	MS13	GREETING	0	Good work closing the Oblivion Gate, you've made my job much easier and safer. Thanks!	
FormID: 0003359E	MS13	GREETING	1	If you're looking for Amminus, he's resting in the Knights Lodge over there.	
FormID: 00032E04	MS13	GREETING	0	Please speak to Amminus. He can tell you what you need to know.	
FormID: 000335A3	MS13	GREETING	0	Amminus can answer any questions you may have. He should be resting in the Knights of the Thorn Lodge over yonder.	
FormID: 0001822C	MS12	GREETING	0	Have you recovered the Madstone?	
FormID: 0001822D	MS12	GREETING	0	I'm pleased you decided to find the Madstone. It will be the highlight of my collection.	
FormID: 0001822F	MS12	GREETING	0	Back to take me up on that offer, eh? I knew you couldn't resist.	
FormID: 00018231	MS12	GREETING	0	I've heard much about your deeds from my people in Bruma.	
FormID: 00018231	MS12	GREETING	1	I trust that the stipend Tolgan gave you whetted your appetite?	
FormID: 0001823A	MS12	GREETING	0	Hear me out before you make your decision.	
FormID: 000980C7	MS12	GREETING	0	I think I know why you're here, but I'd speak to my herald, Tolgan, first. I believe he has something for you. Then return to me.	
FormID: 000980C8	MS12	GREETING	0	Welcome to Bruma Castle. What's brought you here today?	
FormID: 0007BE56	MS12	GREETING	0	You have made a long and perilous journey, but there is no time to rest.	
FormID: 0007BE56	MS12	GREETING	1	The Army of Reman is at our doorstep, and our supplies have dwindled.	
FormID: 0007BE56	MS12	GREETING	2	We have awaited your arrival. Tell us, what news do you bring from Akavir?	
FormID: 0001C4C8	MS12	GREETING	0	If you have the item my Lady seeks, I suggest you bring it to her. She hasn't slept a wink since you departed.	
FormID: 0001C48A	MS12	GREETING	0	I'm sorry. You must speak to Countess Carvain for any further information.	
FormID: 0001C496	MS12	GREETING	0	Good day. I'm Tolgan, herald to Countess Narina Carvain here in Bruma. She requests your company at your earliest convenience.	
FormID: 000980CF	MS12	GREETING	0	Good day. I'm Tolgan, herald to Countess Narina Carvain.	
FormID: 0001FDAD	MS08	GREETING	0	I'm impressed that you killed all my clients. Doesn't matter. More will come along with their purses fat with gold and hearts lustin' for blood.	
FormID: 0001FDAD	MS08	GREETING	1	Too bad about Aleron. Didn't need him anymore now that yer here. At least now he's free of his debt... ha ha ha ha!	
FormID: 0001F41C	MS08	GREETING	0	Get on that boat and get out of here. Yer wastin' yer own time.	
FormID: 0001F41E	MS08	GREETING	0	Are you ready to go to the boat?	
FormID: 0001F41F	MS08	GREETING	0	Yeah? What do you want?	
FormID: 0001F420	MS08	GREETING	0	What are you lookin' at? Get outta' my sight before I have you hacked off at the knees.	
FormID: 0001FDAF	MS08	GREETING	0	Something's wrong... I can tell. What's happened to Aleron?	
FormID: 0001FDB0	MS08	GREETING	0	I'm hoping you bring me good news.	
FormID: 0001F421	MS08	GREETING	0	I'm afraid there isn't much else to tell you. Just be careful.	
FormID: 0001F429	MS08	GREETING	0	I'm sorry to impose upon you like this, but I'm in need of assistance, and I don't know what to do. My husband, Aleron, is missing.	
FormID: 0001FDB2	MS08	GREETING	0	You've killed all three? Wonderful! Now you must find the key. According to Kurdan, it should be on one of their bodies.	
FormID: 0001FDB4	MS08	GREETING	0	I don't trust Kurdan. Even if the hunters are beaten, make sure you watch your back.	
FormID: 0001FDB6	MS08	GREETING	0	I only wish to return home and be with my wife, Ursanne.	
FormID: 0001FDB9	MS08	GREETING	0	It appears as though Kurdan has tricked another poor soul with his [QUOTE]axe[QUOTE] story.	
FormID: 000366CB	MS06	GREETING	0	I knew one day someone with unyielding virtue would heed my words and speed my release. You risked much to perform such a selfless act.	
FormID: 000366CB	MS06	GREETING	1	This noble deed will not go unrewarded. Look upon the ground in this prison. There you will find a map to my gratitude.	
FormID: 000366CB	MS06	GREETING	2	I thank you with all my heart. Farewell.	
FormID: 00035D8D	MS06	GREETING	0	I was once the man known as Grantham Blakeley. Look for me in the mouth of the panther. Please... release me.	
FormID: 000377D4	MS05	GREETING	0	It's good to see you in the real world. I'm indebted to you for rescuing me from my nightmare.	
FormID: 000377D4	MS05	GREETING	1	I suppose thanks are only a small token of my appreciation. Allow me to reward you for your bravery.	
FormID: 000377D4	MS05	GREETING	2	I'm afraid I don't have much in the way of coin, but allow me to present you with something that may help in your travels.	
FormID: 0002C6D3	MS05	GREETING	0	I feel as though I'll be trapped here forever, and I don't even know why.	
FormID: 0002C6D4	MS05	GREETING	0	Have you found an exit to this place yet? We must escape!	
FormID: 0002C6D6	MS05	GREETING	0	I've lost my way. This place looks so familiar, but I can't remember how I got here. Can you help me?	
FormID: 0003CD5E	MS05	GREETING	0	I see you slept well. Welcome home.	
FormID: 0002C6D7	MS05	GREETING	0	It's so difficult to be here and watch him not knowing how much he may be suffering.	
FormID: 0002C6D8	MS05	GREETING	0	Are you prepared to enter the Dreamworld?	
FormID: 0002C6DA	MS05	GREETING	0	Well, as you can see, Henantier's right here and he's trapped in his Dreamworld.	
FormID: 00027F2F	MS05	GREETING	0	It's just this way, not much farther.	
FormID: 00027F30	MS05	GREETING	0	Are you ready to follow me to Henantier?	
FormID: 00027F33	MS05	GREETING	0	What brings you to me today, friend?	
FormID: 00027F36	MS05	GREETING	0	I don't suppose you could help me locate my friend Henantier could you?	
FormID: 00003A64	MS02	GREETING	0	I'm sorry for running away like that, but fear got the best of me.	
FormID: 00003A64	MS02	GREETING	1	I'm glad you talked me into coming with you. Now that the curse has been lifted, I feel like I've taken care of my family's unfinished business.	
FormID: 00003A64	MS02	GREETING	2	Excellent work, my friend. May the manor give you many years of happiness. I'm now off to the Imperial City once more. Farewell!	
FormID: 00003A65	MS02	GREETING	0	I'm pleased we were able to get that secret door open, but I fear I can no longer assist you here. I'll wait for you at The Count's Arms.	
FormID: 0000BCBE	MS02	GREETING	0	Not much more I can do to help you.	
FormID: 0000945E	MS02	GREETING	0	Okay, you lead from here. Hopefully we can make it to the basement without too much fighting.	
FormID: 0000945F	MS02	GREETING	0	Lead on.	
FormID: 0000A0D9	MS02	GREETING	0	Did you want to continue to the manor?	
FormID: 00003A66	MS02	GREETING	0	I was half expecting you not to show up. Are you ready to go to the manor?	
FormID: 00009271	MS02	GREETING	0	Are you ready to go to the manor?	
FormID: 00003A67	MS02	GREETING	0	As I said, I'll meet you back in Anvil as soon as I can. I won't be traveling with you as I'm making my own arrangements.	
FormID: 00003A68	MS02	GREETING	0	I'm surprised to see you all the way out here in the Imperial City.	
FormID: 00009C2A	MS02	GREETING	0	You're a persistent one.	
FormID: 00003A69	MS02	GREETING	0	You got quite a deal on that house.	
FormID: 00003A6B	MS02	GREETING	0	That manor is still for sale if you're interested.	
FormID: 00003A6A	MS02	GREETING	0	Hello, I am Velwyn Benirus. If you're in the market, I'm selling a manor house right now for a very good price.	
FormID: 0001E894	MS02	GREETING	0	You wouldn't happen to be in the market for a home would you? If you are, I just happen to be selling a manor located right here in Anvil.	
FormID: 00038EDE	MS52	GREETING	0	Release! Sweet Release! After all these years, these decades, I am finally free! And you! So... so fresh! I must feed! I must feed! Agghhhhh!	
FormID: 0003D489	MS04	GREETING	0	I see you took us up on our offer. Good. I'm glad to see you. Signy will be along shortly. I'm sure we can find something to do while we wait.	REC - Seductive, Innuendo-laden
FormID: 0003D489	MS04	GREETING	1	Now we can't have you standing there all uncomfortable in all those clothes. Why don't you take everything off and place it there on the table.	
FormID: 0003D48B	MS04	GREETING	0	I see you decided to take us up on our offer. Good. We could use another gal in the gang.	
FormID: 0003D48B	MS04	GREETING	1	Here's how it works. We case The Flowing Bowl for a likely subject. Namely, we look for a married guy who drinks a lot.	
FormID: 0003D48B	MS04	GREETING	2	Then we'll send you in there where you charm the man and get him to come out to some location we pick to rob him.	
FormID: 0003D48B	MS04	GREETING	3	When he gets there, we make him take off all his clothes, which is very easy by the way. While they're helpless, that's when we spring the trap.	
FormID: 0003D48B	MS04	GREETING	4	So far, we haven't had to draw one drop of blood. The best part of the whole thing is that the men are so embarrassed, they won't tell the guards!	
FormID: 0003D48B	MS04	GREETING	5	So, the bottom line is, you show a little skin... just a tease. No one touches you. What do you say?	
FormID: 0003D48C	MS04	GREETING	0	See you at eleven. I hope.	
FormID: 0003D48E	MS04	GREETING	0	Can't wait to see you later. Don't keep us waiting.	REC - Seductive, Innuendo-laden
FormID: 0003D48D	MS04	GREETING	0	Never seen you here before.	
FormID: 0003D48D	MS04	GREETING	1	You look like you can handle yourself in a fight. And I'm sure you wouldn't mind making a little extra money. Hmmmm...	
FormID: 0003D48D	MS04	GREETING	2	I've put together a, well... a gang. We make money by luring fools out to the middle of nowhere and robbing them blind.	
FormID: 0003D48D	MS04	GREETING	3	Our targets? Weak willed men who are easily fooled into believing they will have their way with us. Hahaha... men are so gullible.	
FormID: 0003D48D	MS04	GREETING	4	I leave the decision up to you. If you want to join up, meet us at the Gweden farmhouse around 11 in the evening. I'll mark it on your map.	
FormID: 0003D48D	MS04	GREETING	5	Oh, and one more thing, if you breathe a word of this to the city guard, you won't live long enough to get whatever reward they're offering.	
FormID: 0003D48F	MS04	GREETING	0	Signy wants to talk to you. I think you'll like what she has to say.	REC - Seductive, Innuendo-laden
FormID: 0003D490	MS04	GREETING	0	Patience. We'll have... all night.	
FormID: 0003D492	MS04	GREETING	0	Be nice to get another pretty face in the gang. Hope to see you there.	
FormID: 0003D491	MS04	GREETING	0	I haven't seen you here before. Awww, and you're all alone too. How sad.	
FormID: 0003D491	MS04	GREETING	1	Well, if you're up to it, I think we can solve that little problem. You see, me and Faustina here are lonely too, and we've been looking for someone.	
FormID: 0003D491	MS04	GREETING	2	You look like just what we need.	
FormID: 0003D491	MS04	GREETING	3	I'll tell you what. We have a cozy farmhouse not far from here where we could... well... get to know each other much, much better.	
FormID: 0003D491	MS04	GREETING	4	I'll mark it down on your map, just so you won't forget where to find us. Meet us there around 11 in the evening.	
FormID: 0003D491	MS04	GREETING	5	I can promise you a night of fun you won't soon forget.	
FormID: 0003D493	MS04	GREETING	0	Talk to Faustina. She's got a proposition for you.	
FormID: 0003D495	MS04	GREETING	0	Don't be angry at us. This is the only way we could find the place.	
FormID: 0003D497	MS04	GREETING	0	A farmhouse? Hmmm, last time it was a cabin. They must be moving around. Just be cautious.	
FormID: 0003D498	MS04	GREETING	0	Just hurry back with that ring... please.	
FormID: 0003D499	MS04	GREETING	0	What do you want?	
FormID: 0003D49B	MS04	GREETING	0	We had a feeling you'd be surprised when you saw us in our real uniforms. I see you have a puzzled look on your face. Ask away.	
FormID: 0003D4C5	MS04	GREETING	0	So, they're at Gweden, eh? Good to know. Keep on it.	
FormID: 0003D4A8	MS04	GREETING	0	I knew they would make contact with you. Be careful, there's no telling what they're up to.	
FormID: 0003D306	MS04	GREETING	0	Nothing much more I can help with. I'm afraid you'll have to ask Gogan, my lout of a husband, if you need to know anything else.	
FormID: 0003D306	MS04	GREETING	1	I'm sure he can provide very highly detailed descriptions of the women.	Disgusted (sarcastic)
FormID: 0003D308	MS04	GREETING	0	What can I help with?	
FormID: 0003D309	MS04	GREETING	0	I hope you're here to reconsider.	
FormID: 0003D30A	MS04	GREETING	0	Witches! How dare they prey on our men.	
FormID: 000704BA	MS04	GREETING	0	How would you like to get my husband, Gogan, out of hot water?	
FormID: 0003CF76	MS04	GREETING	0	Back again? You still want to help my good-for-nothing husband?	
FormID: 000A3DED	MS40	GREETING	0	Hush, child. This is serious.	
FormID: 0009811A	MS40	GREETING	0	Now's not the time, little one. The Count has been waiting for you.	
FormID: 000977D6	MS40	GREETING	0	Welcome, welcome!	
FormID: 000977D6	MS40	GREETING	1	I have something for you....	
FormID: 000977DE	MS40	GREETING	0	Now is not the time for talk. I have work to attend to.	
FormID: 00053732	MS40	GREETING	0	Good to see you again. Do you have the Soul Gems I requested?	
FormID: 0003F28D	MS40	GREETING	0	What brings you to this neck of the woods, my lady?	
FormID: 0003F28E	MS40	GREETING	0	What brings you to this neck of the woods, sir?	
FormID: 000A1F62	MS40	GREETING	0	It is good to see you again, my friend.	
FormID: 000A1F62	MS40	GREETING	1	I cannot thank you enough for helping me rescue Rona from the terrible state she was in. I hope that she has found the peace she sought.	
FormID: 000A1F62	MS40	GREETING	2	I'd like to offer you a reward for your efforts.	
FormID: 0009811D	MS40	GREETING	0	Please, go.	
FormID: 0009811E	MS40	GREETING	0	My wife... my beautiful wife.	
FormID: 0009811E	MS40	GREETING	1	Now is not the time for discussion. Give me a day's time to set her affairs in order. Speak with Hai-Liurz tomorrow.	
FormID: 0009811E	MS40	GREETING	2	Please, leave me to my grief.	
FormID: 0009811F	MS40	GREETING	0	Time grows short. The cure must be administered as soon as possible. Please, hand it over.	
FormID: 0009811F	MS40	GREETING	1	Melisande has agreed to help revive Rona long enough for her to drink the potion, and finally be at peace.	
FormID: 0009811F	MS40	GREETING	2	If you are quiet, you may remain. Now, stand aside.	
FormID: 0003E94B	MS40	GREETING	0	I understand you're looking for a cure for vampirism.	
FormID: 0003E94B	MS40	GREETING	1	This is fortunate, as I also seek the cure.	
FormID: 00098120	MS40	GREETING	0	Please, wait here. I shall let the Count know you are waiting for him.	
FormID: 00098121	MS40	GREETING	0	The Count needs more time. He will see you when he is ready.	
FormID: 00098122	MS40	GREETING	0	The Count awaits within. Please, do not delay.	
FormID: 00098123	MS40	GREETING	0	Please just follow me.	
FormID: 00098125	MS40	GREETING	0	Welcome back. Have you completed your task for the Count?

FormID: 0003E94D	MS40	GREETING	0	Greetings. Do you have business at Castle Skingrad?	
FormID: 00068AEC	MS39	GREETING	0	Here to sell me more Nirnroot?	
FormID: 0004E924	MS39	GREETING	0	Please... please. The Grand Elixir of Exploration takes incredible concentration to create. So, shhhhhh.	
FormID: 0004E925	MS39	GREETING	0	You have the next batch of Nirnroot yet?	
FormID: 0004E926	MS39	GREETING	0	Be patient.	
FormID: 0004E927	MS39	GREETING	0	Hey! Good to see you again!	
FormID: 0004E928	MS39	GREETING	0	It would be much easier to make the Elixir if you weren't interrupting me.	
FormID: 0004E92A	MS39	GREETING	0	Any more luck finding Nirnroot?	
FormID: 0004E92B	MS39	GREETING	0	Leave me to my work if you want the Elixir made properly.	
FormID: 0004E92F	MS39	GREETING	0	How goes the search?	
FormID: 0004E930	MS39	GREETING	0	Please, listen to what I have to say; it could be lucrative for the both of us.	
FormID: 0004E941	MS39	GREETING	0	So, you've brought something for me to examine?	
FormID: 0004ED73	MS39	GREETING	0	What can I do for you today? You here to bring me some Nirnroot?	
FormID: 0004F8AF	MS43	GREETING	0	I don't see any scamps, or the staff!	
FormID: 0004F8B0	MS43	GREETING	0	You must be rid of the staff, or the scamps will follow you around forever!	
FormID: 0004F8B3	MS43	GREETING	0	I can't thank you enough for doing this for me.	
FormID: 0004F8B8	MS43	GREETING	0	Are you ready to accept the staff?	
FormID: 0004F8BB	MS43	GREETING	0	I was afraid you wouldn't come back.	
FormID: 0004F8C1	MS43	GREETING	0	Please, don't dawdle here... get to the Mages Guild! Hurry!	
FormID: 0004F78C	MS43	GREETING	0	I'm at my wit's end! I beg you to help me!	
FormID: 0004B7B4	MS43	GREETING	0	These stupid scamps are driving me crazy!	
FormID: 00094EBC	MS43	GREETING	0	You are a person of your word. You must hasten to Rosentia and tell her at once!	
FormID: 00094EC1	MS43	GREETING	0	Back for more information?	
FormID: 00094EC9	MS43	GREETING	0	Poor Rosentia, she's been trapped in her house for days.	
FormID: 000BE55D	MS43	GREETING	0	Nice to meet you.	
FormID: 00053751	MS09	GREETING	0	Sorry, I'm too busy counting the number of rat droppings in my cell.	
FormID: 00053752	MS09	GREETING	0	Show me the proof.	
FormID: 00053753	MS09	GREETING	0	Until you get out of here and I see an amulet, we have nothing more to say to each other.	
FormID: 0005371A	MS09	GREETING	0	By the way the guards tossed you in here, I can see you're no friend of theirs.	
FormID: 0005371B	MS09	GREETING	0	I don't know who you are, nor do I care. All I know is that I want you to leave.	
FormID: 0005371C	MS09	GREETING	0	Go away.	
FormID: 0005375D	MS09	GREETING	0	Well go get it! What good is it doing if you're standing here?	
FormID: 0005375E	MS09	GREETING	0	If you try and cross me, I'll tell the town guard.	
FormID: 00053760	MS09	GREETING	0	So, were you able to find out about the gold or not?	
FormID: 00053720	MS09	GREETING	0	Did you pry any information out of him?	
FormID: 00053721	MS09	GREETING	0	Until you get some information from Jorundr, I don't have anything else to tell you.	
FormID: 00053726	MS09	GREETING	0	I knew the lure of gold couldn't keep you away long.	
FormID: 0005327A	MS09	GREETING	0	Can't you see that I'm upset?	
FormID: 00053774	MS09	GREETING	0	I'm here for Jorundr's gold, and you're my only loose end. I'd been hoping to get someone in his cell and loosen his lips, and then you showed up.	
FormID: 00053774	MS09	GREETING	1	You really should be more careful when you talk in the dungeons... the sound tends to carry. Jorundr's such an idiot.	
FormID: 00053774	MS09	GREETING	2	I've taken care of Arnora, she won't be around to point the finger. And Jorundr's not going anywhere for a long time. That just leaves you...	
FormID: 00053791	MS09	GREETING	0	I don't talk to inmates. Now shut up, and don't bother me.	
FormID: 00090B5E	MS92	GREETING	0	Black Brugo is dead, right? So I'm going to be a knight?	
FormID: 00090B5E	MS92	GREETING	1	I'll go back and wait in the County Hall. You'll tell me when I'm a real knight? Please?	
FormID: 00090B5F	MS92	GREETING	0	I'm with you, friend. We kill Black Brugo, and the Count makes us both knights.	
FormID: 00090B61	MS92	GREETING	0	If you're ready to go get Black Brugo, I'm ready to follow you.	
FormID: 00090B62	MS92	GREETING	0	I kept my oath. Mogens Wind-Shifter is dead. Now I return to Castle Leyawiin. Come visit me there some day.	
FormID: 0008605A	MS92	GREETING	0	Hello, friend. Thank you again for your help.

FormID: 0008605B	MS91	GREETING	0	J'Baasha's an adventurer... just like you.	protesting suspicion; pretending innocence
FormID: 0008605C	MS91	GREETING	0	Ayisha minds Ayisha's business. Maybe you should try this, too.	mildy challenging
FormID: 0008605F	MS91	GREETING	0	I'm not much for small talk. Just leave me out of it.	pretending indifference
FormID: 00086060	MS91	GREETING	0	I hope you've been successful?	
FormID: 00086061	MS91	GREETING	0	Marius Caro, by grace of the Nine, Count Leyawiin. You are a stranger to me, but well-met.	measured, noble diction
FormID: 00086061	MS91	GREETING	1	Perhaps you would like to do a service for County Leyawiin?	
FormID: 00086062	MS91	GREETING	0	Good luck with Mazoga.	
FormID: 00086063	MS91	GREETING	0	I'm going to see Mazoga. Come along, if you like.	
FormID: 00086064	MS91	GREETING	0	I'm Weebam-Na. What do you want?	
FormID: 00086065	MS91	GREETING	0	I kept my oath. Mogens Wind-Shifter is dead.	fury
FormID: 00086065	MS91	GREETING	1	Mogens Wind-Shifter had a gang. They robbed and killed travelers. But Ra'vindra saw, and told the guards.	
FormID: 00086065	MS91	GREETING	2	Mogens got away, but first he killed Ra'vindra... my best friend, Ra'vindra.	
FormID: 00086065	MS91	GREETING	3	That day, I became a knight, and swore a knight's oath.	
FormID: 00086065	MS91	GREETING	4	I searched a long time, and asked everyone, then I finally heard he was hiding at Fisherman's Rock.	
FormID: 00086065	MS91	GREETING	5	So now you know everything. You helped me, and I won't forget.	
FormID: 00086065	MS91	GREETING	6	Take what you want from the dead. I came to keep my oath, and now I'm done.	
FormID: 00086066	MS91	GREETING	0	You spoiled everything, you idiot!	fury
FormID: 0008606A	MS91	GREETING	0	What's the matter? What did you do?	fury
FormID: 00086067	MS91	GREETING	0	Mogens and his dogs must die!	fury
FormID: 0008606C	MS91	GREETING	0	Get out of my way!	fury
FormID: 0008606D	MS91	GREETING	0	Take me to Fisherman's Rock. Now.	irritated, impatient
FormID: 0008606E	MS91	GREETING	0	Weebam-Na won't take me to Fisherman's Rock.	irritated, impatient
FormID: 0008606F	MS91	GREETING	0	Go tell Weebam-Na I want to see him. I'll wait right here.	
FormID: 00086072	MS91	GREETING	0	Are you the Count?	
FormID: 0009381B	MS91	GREETING	0	What do you want?	
FormID: 000860C0	MS91	GREETING	0	You're getting on my nerves. What do you want?	
FormID: 000908A5	MS92FIN	GREETING	0	How are you faring in your campaign against the remnants of the Black Bow Bandits, Sir Knight?	
FormID: 00086059	MS92FIN	GREETING	0	I'm gonna go get me some black bows. Tag along if you like.	
FormID: 00090B60	MS92FIN	GREETING	0	I'm going to spend some time at the Lodge. Then maybe tonight, I might go hunt me some black bows.	
FormID: 00090B66	MS92FIN	GREETING	0	Push off, scroat! We got nothing to talk about.	
FormID: 00090B67	MS92FIN	GREETING	0	I hear Black Brugo is dead.	
FormID: 00090B69	MS92FIN	GREETING	0	Did you tell the Count about Black Brugo?	
FormID: 00095A62	MS93	GREETING	0	This is a travesty. A complete and utter travesty. The crystal ball is just sitting there in the hold, but I'll be damned if I'm going back onboard.	
FormID: 00095A62	MS93	GREETING	1	And nobody will help me. Nobody! Not with those spirits roaming the decks. I don't suppose you'll help me? No, of course you won't...                	
FormID: 00095A63	MS93	GREETING	0	No luck yet, hmm? Please, don't give up. That crystal ball means so much to me. It was my mother's, you see... 	
FormID: 00095A64	MS93	GREETING	0	You did it! You actually made it back with the crystal ball! Oh thank you! Here, please take this as a reward!	
FormID: 00095A64	MS93	GREETING	1	It's the captain's enchanted cutlass. I managed to grab it when I was in his cabin, before his spirit chased me out! Oh, thank you so very much! 	
FormID: 00095A65	MS93	GREETING	0	Oh, hello, dear friend! Let me just say once more how happy I am to have my crystal ball back. I'll never forget your selflessness and bravery!	
FormID: 00014D5B	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Kvatch was rebuilt from ruins once before and she'll do it again. You have my thanks.	
FormID: 0000BEDD	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Enjoy the manor. It suits you well.	
FormID: 00086767	MSFIN	GREETING	0	I can't believe you did that. Maelona is furious.	
FormID: 0003D496	MSFIN	GREETING	0	They still aren't letting me live this down.	
FormID: 0003D49A	MSFIN	GREETING	0	We have a lot of paperwork and follow-up investigation to do. Please, leave us to it.	
FormID: 0008676A	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Stupid... just plain stupid.	
FormID: 0003D49E	MSFIN	GREETING	0	I'm afraid I have very little information to add to our follow-up investigation.	
FormID: 0003CA7A	MSFIN	GREETING	0	So good to see you again!	
FormID: 0018B123	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Please go away. I have no wish to speak to you.	
FormID: 0003CCA0	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Now that Henantier has returned, things are as they should be.	
FormID: 0003CCAC	MSFIN	GREETING	0	This thing you've done goes beyond what I would have expected from you. You've chosen a dark path, and I shall help you get there sooner!	
FormID: 0009079D	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Well, this saves me a bit of trouble. Aleron's dead even though I planned to kill him anyway. So, that just leaves you. Let the game continue!	
FormID: 0009079E	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Thanks for doing my work for me. Nothing like having someone else do your dirty laundry. Thanks, you idiot!	
FormID: 000907A0	MSFIN	GREETING	0	You idiot! How could you kill Kurdan before you got Aleron to safety? Get... get out of my sight!	
FormID: 000907A1	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Please, I wish to be alone with my thoughts.	
FormID: 0001FDAE	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Please. I wish to be alone with my thoughts.	
FormID: 000908E9	MSFIN	GREETING	0	We have nothing to discuss.	
FormID: 0005374A	MSFIN	GREETING	0	I'm not interested in speaking with you!	
FormID: 00090867	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Great... nice work. Now that he's dead, we'll never find the treasure. Just get away from me.	
FormID: 000914D8	MSFIN	GREETING	0	I've nothing to say to you.	
FormID: 0003C334	MSFIN	GREETING	0	You better hope I never get out of here.	
FormID: 000914DB	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Wha'? You sellin' something? Go away, I'm broke!	
FormID: 000914DE	MSFIN	GREETING	0	I'm far too busy to speak to you right now.	
FormID: 0003C338	MSFIN	GREETING	0	As always, you're a welcome sight.	
FormID: 000914DF	MSFIN	GREETING	0	I'm really not interested in speaking to you right now.	
FormID: 0003C36E	MSFIN	GREETING	0	I'm overjoyed to hear that Garrus has replaced Ulrich as the Captain of the Guard. I'm sure he'll do a fine job.	
FormID: 00018227	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Good to see you again.	
FormID: 0001C489	MSFIN	GREETING	0	I've never seen my Lady so happy. You've done well.	
FormID: 000A3B2E	MSFIN	GREETING	0	What's wrong with you? Farwil may have been a pain in the rear, but that was no reason to slay him!	
FormID: 00031E9D	MSFIN	GREETING	0	How good to see you again, fellow knight.	
FormID: 000A3B2F	MSFIN	GREETING	0	You have some nerve addressing me after slaying my son. You're lucky I didn't have you executed on the spot! Now get out of my sight!	
FormID: 0002D2D6	MSFIN	GREETING	0	I'm sorry, although I wish to spend time speaking with you, I have much business to attend to. Please be brief.	
FormID: 0002E35E	MSFIN	GREETING	0	I'm pleased that a Knight of the Thorn has received such a worthy gift. Even if you're just an honorary knight.	
FormID: 000A3B30	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Are you mad? You killed Farwil, and now you casually speak to me as if nothing's happened? Begone from my sight before I kill you where you stand!	
FormID: 0001BB20	MSFIN	GREETING	0	My house is yours, friend. Please, come back to visit us anytime.	
FormID: 0001BB26	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Please leave. I have no wish to speak with you any longer.	
FormID: 0001BB28	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Please, share the hospitality of our home.	
FormID: 0008B070	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Please, I no longer have a desire to speak with you. I appreciate what you've done in the past, but that's just what it is... the past.	
FormID: 0008B071	MSFIN	GREETING	0	It's a fine day is it not?	
FormID: 0008B078	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Please go away.	
FormID: 00143F0B	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Our business is done.	
FormID: 00143F0C	MSFIN	GREETING	0	You've made your choice... now leave me be.	
FormID: 000980C4	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Our sister returns to the fold!	
FormID: 0001DA4C	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Our brother returns to the fold!	
FormID: 000980CA	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Hmph.	
FormID: 0001DA51	MSFIN	GREETING	0	I'm sorry, I'm very busy now. There's still much work to be done. Good day.	
FormID: 000980D6	MSFIN	GREETING	0	I've more important things to do than chat with you right now.	
FormID: 000980D7	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Yes, sister?	
FormID: 0001DA56	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Yes, brother?	
FormID: 0001DA57	MSFIN	GREETING	0	How can I help?	
FormID: 000980EA	MSFIN	GREETING	0	Important things to do... so many important things to do.	
FormID: 000980EB	MSFIN	GREETING	0	What can the Order help you with, sister?	
FormID: 0001DA5F	MSFIN	GREETING	0	What can the Order help you with, brother?

FormID: 0008F7BA	SE34	GREETING	0	If you could help Pyke, I think you'd make him very happy.	
FormID: 0008F7BA	SE34	GREETING	1	I've grown quite fond of him and can't stand seeing him this way.	
FormID: 0008F7BA	SE34	GREETING	2	I'm still working up the nerve to paint his portrait, but I'd rather do it when he's back to his happier self.	
FormID: 0006EA47	SE41	GREETING	0	I hope you have something for me.	Sound weak and frail. As if you have a bad fever. But you're faking it. Cough during dialog.
FormID: 0006D603	SE41	GREETING	0	Hello again... talk to me while you can. I don't think I've got too long.	Sound weak and frail. As if you have a bad fever. But you're faking it.
FormID: 0006D605	SE41	GREETING	0	Sickly Bernice, proprietor. Don't get too close now. You might catch what I have.	Sound weak and frail. As if you have a bad fever. But you're faking it.
FormID: 0007AC6C	SE35	GREETING	0	Have you dealt with Brithaur? I'm not getting any younger here waiting for you. You must hurry and get rid of him!	
FormID: 0007AC6E	SE35	GREETING	0	Firm arms. A strong back. Yes. You'd do nicely. It's a shame. Time will ravage you, destroy you. Whither you. But there are... alternatives.	About to deliver a sales pitch.
FormID: 0007AC6E	SE35	GREETING	1	Time need not slow you. Tell me, have you ever considered placing yourself on display?	
FormID: 0008F7D7	SE35	GREETING	0	Well? What is it you need. Please, be quick about it... the seconds are ticking by as we speak. Ohhhh. There goes several more.	Ohhh is an exasperation noise.

FormID: 0007AC75	SE35	GREETING	0	So, you have the pearls? Or perhaps any other things of value I can have -- I mean, hold for you?	
FormID: 0007AC76	SE35	GREETING	0	Well, hello there. It's good to see such a well-equipped individual as yourself around these parts.	
FormID: 0007AC76	SE35	GREETING	1	But you look tired. Carrying all that gear will do that to you. I'd be glad to shoulder some of the burden... relieve you of that expensive stuff.	
FormID: 0007AC76	SE35	GREETING	2	Or is there something else I can take from -- I mean, help you with?	
FormID: 00072DAB	SE43	GREETING	0	You... you're a cat! Get away from me!	Shock, then fear

FormID: 0008151C	SE43	GREETING	0	That cat beggar is following me! He's going to eat me, I just know it. Don't look! He's standing right over there.

FormID: 0018BAFB	ImperialLegionDialogue	GREETING	0	Well met, citizen. I see few new faces these days, it seems. With the Emperor's murder, a darkness has fallen upon all of Cyrodiil. 	
FormID: 0018BAFC	ImperialLegionDialogue	GREETING	0	Speak quickly! I have no time for mindless blather!	
FormID: 0018BAFD	ImperialLegionDialogue	GREETING	0	I welcome a friendly face in these dark times. How can I be of assistance?

FormID: 0018BAFF	ImperialLegionDialogue	GREETING	0	Make it fast, dreg! What little patience I have is wearing thin....	
FormID: 0018BB00	ImperialLegionDialogue	GREETING	0	I did not join the Imperial Legion to engage in small talk with rabble like you. If you have something to say, say it.

FormID: 0006144A	ImperialLegionDialogue	GREETING	0	I don't see many wanderers out here in the wild. But you look like you can take of yourself.	
FormID: 0006FDBD	ImperialLegionDialogue	GREETING	0	By the gods, the snow's coming down! What brings you out here in the cold, citizen?	
FormID: 0006FDBE	ImperialLegionDialogue	GREETING	0	Well now, I didn't expect to see anyone else foolish enough to venture out here in the rain! How do you fare, citizen?	
FormID: 0018BB02	ImperialLegionDialogue	GREETING	0	Any citizen who takes the time to talk to a member of the Legion is okay in my book. With all that's happened, it's good to know we're appreciated. 	
FormID: 0006FDBF	ImperialLegionDialogue	GREETING	0	State your business, citizen.	
FormID: 0006FDC0	ImperialLegionDialogue	GREETING	0	You have a death wish, citizen? Put that weapon away. Now.	
FormID: 0006FDC1	ImperialLegionDialogue	GREETING	0	Mind telling me why you're sneakin' about? I don't think I have to tell you what the Legion thinks of thieves, now do I?	
FormID: 0006FDC2	ImperialLegionDialogue	GREETING	0	You. I've seen your kind before. You've got blood on your hands. Keep your blade sheathed, you murdering bastard, or I'll put you down myself.	
FormID: 0006FDC3	ImperialLegionDialogue	GREETING	0	Bet you think you're somethin' huh? You call yourself a citizen of the Empire? No respect for order, no respect for law. You make me sick.	
FormID: 0006FDC4	ImperialLegionDialogue	GREETING	0	Ah, it's good to see you, citizen! Oh yes, I know who you are. You've become something of a legend in these parts!

FormID: 00070289	ImperialLegionDialogue	GREETING	0	Hail, citizen! It's not often I see another rider out here on the roads. Times being what they are.	
FormID: 0007028A	ImperialLegionDialogue	GREETING	0	Greetings, citizen. How can this Legion horseman be of service?	
FormID: 0007028B	ImperialLegionDialogue	GREETING	0	Please make it quick, citizen. My patrol awaits, and a Legion steed can't keep still for very long...

FormID: 00081F3B	SE46	GREETING	0	You sure didn't mess things up. No. Not at all. Didn't make things much worse. Not at all.

FormID: 0004300F	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Hello. I'm Atrabhi! People think I'm not friendly because I'm always reading. I enjoy a good conversation, though.	friendly
FormID: 00043010	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Welcome, I'm very glad to see you again. No really, why do you look so doubtful? Have people been lying about me again?	overly friendly (and compulsively lying)
FormID: 00043011	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Do you like visitng Split? It's a great place to live. The people are charming, and the weather is fantastic. No, really, it's true! Why would I lie?	overly friendly (and compulsively lying)
FormID: 00043012	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	I have it on good authority that that bookworm, Atrabhi is a compulsive liar. My only fault is my naive trusting honesty. How can I help you, friend?	overly friendly (and compulsively lying)
FormID: 00043013	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Hello. My name isn't Atrabhi, I don't know why everyone calls me that. And I don't know where I get this reputation for being a liar, either.	overly friendly (and compulsively lying)
FormID: 00043014	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Oh, hello. The real world just isn't as colorful as the ones in the story books, is it? Nor as truthful as the essays and histories. Alas.	friendly but longing to be reading again instead of talking.
FormID: 00043015	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Hi there. You remind me of one of the characters from a story I've been reading. What can I do for you?	friendly but longing to be reading again instead of talking.

FormID: 0001F365	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Hello, my name is Tove. [QUOTE]The Unrestful,[QUOTE] they call me. So much to do, and so little time. There's only one of me to go around, you know!	
FormID: 0001F366	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Hello there. You don't have any experience building boats, do you? I'm rather stuck, what without any instructions and all. Confusing stuff.	
FormID: 0001F369	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Orinthal, retired Assassin. Now I live here. Only Redguard here, incidentally. An interesting fact, isn't it? I do enjoy facts.	
FormID: 0001F36A	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Hello again. You don't happen to recall how many steps you took in getting here, do you? I was just wondering.	
FormID: 0001F36D	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Greetings. Did you know that I slept for exactly 237 minutes last night? I find that fascinating.	
FormID: 0001F36E	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Hello there. Have I mentioned that my left arm is actually one inch longer than my right? Never know when that might be important.	
FormID: 0001F374	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	I am Wide-Eye, Steward to His Grace, the greatest Duke of Mania in all of history, Thadon. He is my reason for being. My purpose in life.	
FormID: 0001F375	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Are you here to see Thadon? I would be, if I were you. Thankfully, I already have cause to speak to him every day.	
FormID: 0003B971	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	So many forks. Not the True Fork. Only it sings. Have you the Fork for Big Head? Fork that sings? Fork that rings?	
FormID: 0003B972	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Pretty, pretty forks. Singing sad, sad songs. Do you hear them?	
FormID: 00078210	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	What do you need, Sparkles? I'm always here. Can't afford to sleep. Can't be too careful.	
FormID: 00078211	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	So far, so good. If this world's a dream, I'm not waking up.

FormID: 0003E986	SENQDMania	GREETING	1	Um. Oh, no. I lost count. Crap. Okay. Well, what do you want?	
FormID: 0003E9C5	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	1, 2, 3... is this important? 4, 5, 6... I'm counting... 8, 9. Oh, no. I missed 7. Speak up before I get mad!	
FormID: 00040BBE	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Rendil Drarara, chef extraordinaire at your service.	
FormID: 00040BBE	SENQDMania	GREETING	1	You haven't truly eaten a decent meal until you've had my Strawberry Harrada, Greenmote Lime Surprise, and Spiderling Under Glass!	
FormID: 00040B9B	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Make this brief, I have a pot of Grummite Gumbo simmering on my fire at home.	
FormID: 00040BBF	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Hmmm... how do you do? I'd say, very well from the look of things.	As if examining the appearance of the person you are speaking to and heavy on the sexual innuendo (seductive).
FormID: 00040BBF	SENQDMania	GREETING	1	I'm Sontaire, spend one night with me and I'll remind you why they say [QUOTE]love hurts.[QUOTE]	Heavy on the sexual innuendo (seductive).
FormID: 00040B9C	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	So, how'd you like to get together later and leaf through my octavo?	As if examining the appearance of the person you are speaking to and heavy on the sexual innuendo (seductive).
FormID: 00040BC0	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	New around here? Well, we can start off by getting one thing straight.	
FormID: 00040BC0	SENQDMania	GREETING	1	The men around here are mine. You want fresh pickings, go out and scrounge up some leftovers in a settlement or something.	
FormID: 00040BC1	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	I don't like competition. Just stay away from the menfolk, and we'll get along just fine.	
FormID: 00040BC2	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	I bid you greetings and cheer, with the grace of a noble stallion. You seem to be of fine temper and wit, says the poet known as Halion.	
FormID: 00040BC3	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	As I look upon your face, you remind me of a summer's day. Of a distant and secret place not so far away.	
FormID: 00040BC4	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Zoe Malene's the name. Sorry I don't have much time to have a formal introduction, but I must get my latest painting finished!	
FormID: 00040BC4	SENQDMania	GREETING	1	Not that it matters, really. I'm sure I'll lose my inspiration halfway through.	
FormID: 00040BC5	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	I don't have time for this; I must get back to my next catastrophic waste of time.	VERY sarcastic
FormID: 00040BC6	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Who am I? How about a failure, a fraud, an utter sham. I'm a poet without merit, a slave to my own stupidity and will likely ruin your day.	
FormID: 00040BC7	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Why should I get up to greet the day when every living thing mocks me?	
FormID: 00041094	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	You're new here, so I'll try to be patient with you.	
FormID: 00041094	SENQDMania	GREETING	1	I am compiling a taxonomy of every living thing in the Shivering Isles, the weather, changes in the moon and stars, and their interrelationships.	
FormID: 00041094	SENQDMania	GREETING	2	I must not be interrupted! My work requires the highest degree of concentration. I hope I won't have to repeat myself.	
FormID: 00041095	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Can't you see I was in the middle of my daily dewfall survey? Now I have to start all over again.	
FormID: 00041096	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	You've interrupted my tree growth measurements! You've ruined a whole day's work! Why can't you just leave me alone?	
FormID: 00041097	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	I'm sure you didn't see it, but there was a very interesting beetle right there. Now it's gone, of course.	
FormID: 00041097	SENQDMania	GREETING	1	How will I ever finish the Encylopedia Sheothia with these constant interruptions!?	in extreme exasperation
FormID: 00041098	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Is it so hard to leave me alone to get some work done? My wind and humidity measurements must be VERY precise!	
FormID: 00041098	SENQDMania	GREETING	1	Now it's all... ruined... I have to start everything over from the beginning!	muttering to herself in exasperation
FormID: 0004BB66	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Why won't you just leave me alone? What do you want?	
FormID: 00041099	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	I would prefer that you didn't disturb me at home. My research is exhausting and I don't like to be bothered here.	
FormID: 000411FA	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Ah, a stranger in town. But as I always say, a stranger is just a friend I haven't met yet!	
FormID: 000411FA	SENQDMania	GREETING	1	Hey, friend, do you think you could help me out? I'm caught a bit short at the moment... anything at all would be much appreciated.	
FormID: 000411FB	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	What do you need, friend? Anything for you.	
FormID: 000411FC	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Hey, got any apples? Or carrots? Anything at all crunchy and yummy to eat?	
FormID: 000411FD	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	My feet hurt so bad. I could sure use a new pair of shoes. Can you help me out? Please?	
FormID: 000411FE	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Do you think you can spare a little something for an old friend? You know I'm good for it.	
FormID: 000411FF	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Have you caught my act yet? I'm Thaedil, the juggler. I'm sure you've heard of me.	
FormID: 000411FF	SENQDMania	GREETING	1	Oh, who am I kidding? More likely you came to scoff at the worst juggler in the world.	
FormID: 00041200	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Did you see that? Twelve balls in the air at once! No one has EVER juggled that many at once.	
FormID: 00041201	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Is there anything more pathetic than a clumsy juggler? Don't even look at me!	
FormID: 00041202	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Once I've perfected my act, I'll be the toast of the Realm!	
FormID: 00041203	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Don't be shy. I'm really very approachable. You wanted an autograph, is that it?	
FormID: 00041204	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	I'm awful. Just awful! Why I became a juggler I'll never know. My mother pushed me into it.	
FormID: 00041205	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	You saw my last show, and came to mock me, right? Don't worry, I already know. I disgust myself.	
FormID: 00043000	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Hey there. I'm Horkvir Bear-Arm. They call me that because I once wrestled a bear, not because I work all day out in my garden without a shirt on.	
FormID: 00043003	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Hey there. I'm really busy. Got lots to do. So if you don't mind, make it quick.	
FormID: 00043004	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	I guess I can spare you a minute. But not more than that. I've got to get back to work. Always more work to do than time to do it.	
FormID: 00043007	SENQDMania	GREETING	0	Well, I guess I can take a short break. A short one, mind you. I have lots to do still.	
FormID: 00041F18	SENQDWilderness	GREETING	0	I'm Yngvar the Wanderer. Although most people now call me Yngvar Doom-Sayer. It's true, the world is about to be destroyed.	
FormID: 00041F18	SENQDWilderness	GREETING	1	Some people are frightened by this, or they despair, or even try to deny the truth of what I say.	
FormID: 00041F18	SENQDWilderness	GREETING	2	But my message is actually one of comfort. The world is ending, and we can't do anything about it. Once you accept that, you'll be at peace, like me.	
FormID: 00041F19	SENQDWilderness	GREETING	0	Spread the word. The world is coming to an end. But it's nothing to worry about.	
FormID: 00041F1A	SENQDWilderness	GREETING	0	I don't understand... the world was supposed to end.... Order was supposed to destroy everything. It has always happened that way.	
FormID: 0008EA34	SENQDGeneric	GREETING	0	Your work is done here, Your Grace. I'm sure Sheogorath will want news of your success.	
FormID: 0008EA35	SENQDGeneric	GREETING	0	Your work is done here, Your Grace. I'm sure Sheogorath will want news of your success.

FormID: 0008D31C	SENQDGeneric	GREETING	0	So many figures to compile. Would that I had your infinite wisdom, Lord.	
FormID: 0008D31D	SENQDGeneric	GREETING	0	I am here to serve, Lord. May I assist in Your great works?	
FormID: 0008D31F	SENQDGeneric	GREETING	0	Lord Sheogorath, here in Deepwallow? May Scalon blood flow at your feet, Lord!	
FormID: 0008D32C	SENQDGeneric	GREETING	0	My Lord comes to Deepwallow to make it safe?	
FormID: 000825AA	SENQDGeneric	GREETING	0	I'm afraid I cannot follow you beyond this point, Inquisitor. My duties require me to stay within Crucible. I shall be there if you need me.	
FormID: 0008256E	SENQDGeneric	GREETING	0	Lord, you know that Pinnacle Rock is ours and ours alone. You may not enter.	
FormID: 00082570	SENQDGeneric	GREETING	0	Lord, you know that Brellach is ours and ours alone. You may not enter.

FormID: 00081D70	SENQDGeneric	GREETING	0	My Lord! What can I do for you?	
FormID: 00081D71	SENQDGeneric	GREETING	0	Madgod! I've been collecting jokes for you. I have thousands for you to listen to. Did you hear the one about the Grummite and the Heretic?	a perpetual jokester believing he has finally found someone who wants to listen to all his jokes[CRLF]
FormID: 00081D74	SENQDGeneric	GREETING	0	Lord Sheogorath, up off his throne and slumming it with us little folk, eh? Well, it's good to see you. What can I possibly do for you, My Lord?	grumpy and anti-social, doesn't want to be talking, even if it is to his god
FormID: 00081D77	SENQDGeneric	GREETING	0	I wonder. Do gods have bones? What wonderful things those must be!	obsessed with killing things and taking their bones

FormID: 00081D85	SENQDGeneric	GREETING	0	Greetings, Madgod. I normally don't stop to chit-chat, but it's truly an honor. What can I do for you?	a workaholic takes a break to talk to his God.
FormID: 00081D86	SENQDGeneric	GREETING	0	Sheogorath. What trouble brings you out this way?	grumpy and would rather not be bothered
FormID: 00081D87	SENQDGeneric	GREETING	0	My Lord Sheogorath! Please kill me!	desperately wants to die

FormID: 00081522	SENQDGeneric	GREETING	0	Lord Sheogorath. I'll bet your palace is always neat and tidy.	
FormID: 00081523	SENQDGeneric	GREETING	0	For you, Lord Sheogorath, I'll make time. I'm sure you want to ask me all about my research.	
FormID: 00081524	SENQDGeneric	GREETING	0	I'd like my mind back, if you please. Or not. It's really up to you, Lord Sheogorath.

FormID: 00007B31	MG05Fingers	Recommendation	1	If perhaps you can clear up a small matter involving Earana, you can prove your loyalty to the guild and earn my recommendation.	
FormID: 000513BE	MG06Bruma	Recommendation	0	Once I can see J'skar again, I'd be more than happy to write a recommendation for you.	
FormID: 0002D590	MG06Bruma	Recommendation	0	A recommendation, from me?	
FormID: 0002D590	MG06Bruma	Recommendation	1	Well, of course. Raminus would naturally want my opinion, wouldn't he?	
FormID: 0002D590	MG06Bruma	Recommendation	2	This is a situation we can both benefit from, Associate. You do me a small favor, and I'll happily send along a glowing recommendation.	
FormID: 0002D590	MG06Bruma	Recommendation	3	If you can find J'skar, I'll write the recommendation immediately.	
FormID: 00034864	MG07Leyawiin	Recommendation	0	If you've got the amulet, then Dagail should be able to regain control of her visions. Then I'm sure she can send that recommendation for you.	
FormID: 00033794	MG07Leyawiin	Recommendation	0	You'll have to speak to Dagail. I just don't understand what it is she wants.	
FormID: 0002DB91	MG07Leyawiin	Recommendation	0	I take it you've spoken to Dagail? Then you know she is not well.	
FormID: 0002DB91	MG07Leyawiin	Recommendation	1	She has visions, for lack of a better term. While they used to be helpful at times, they have lately become problematic.	
FormID: 0002DB91	MG07Leyawiin	Recommendation	2	There was an amulet, a family heirloom, that she wore to suppress, and sometimes focus, the visions. She's lost the amulet, and so has lost control.	
FormID: 0002DB97	MG07Leyawiin	Recommendation	0	Ah, yes. I'm afraid I'm unable to issue a recommendation. Only Dagail can do that.	
FormID: 0002DB97	MG07Leyawiin	Recommendation	1	You may try to speak to her. If... if it doesn't go well, come see me.	
FormID: 000514B4	MG07Leyawiin	Recommendation	0	You'll have to speak to Dagail about that.	
FormID: 000514B5	MG07Leyawiin	Recommendation	0	That's Dagail's responsibility. Speak with her.	
FormID: 000514B6	MG07Leyawiin	Recommendation	0	Oh, boy. Good luck getting that.	
FormID: 000514B6	MG07Leyawiin	Recommendation	1	Dagail's the only one who can write one. If she can remember who she is today, that is.	
FormID: 0002D937	MG01Destruct	Recommendation	0	I've spoken with Erthor, who seems to be all right. Good work. I'll see to it that your recommendation is sent in, as soon as I have a free moment.	
FormID: 0002D937	MG01Destruct	Recommendation	1	As I've said, I am rather busy. I'll get to it eventually though, I assure you.	
FormID: 0002D6E1	MG01Destruct	Recommendation	0	Have you reconsidered? I'd still be willing to do that job for you, if you want. It'd only cost you 300 gold.	
FormID: 0002D6E2	MG01Destruct	Recommendation	0	I tell you what. I have some outstanding debts I need to pay off. You help me out with that, and I'll help you out with getting Erthor back.	
FormID: 0002D6E2	MG01Destruct	Recommendation	1	Heck, I'll even go do the job for you for 300 gold. When Erthor gets back, you can take the credit. What do you say?	
FormID: 0002D6E3	MG01Destruct	Recommendation	0	So you're supposed to go out and rescue Erthor, eh?  I'd love to help out. I just don't quite feel comfortable doing that, though.	
FormID: 0002D6E4	MG01Destruct	Recommendation	0	I hear Adrienne is sending you out to get Erthor. Is that right?	
FormID: 0002D6E4	MG01Destruct	Recommendation	1	Hmm. It's a pity you don't have the right sort of friends. Friends that would be willing to help out with a task like that.	
FormID: 0002D6E5	MG01Destruct	Recommendation	0	Any luck finding Erthor yet? I'll need to speak with him before I can feel your recommendation has been earned.	
FormID: 0002D411	MG01Destruct	Recommendation	0	I'm afraid I haven't given it much thought. I'm rather busy, you understand. My research occupies nearly all of my time.	
FormID: 0002D411	MG01Destruct	Recommendation	1	Now that I think about it, I do have a small problem concerning Erthor. He's one of the guild mages here. Think you can do something about it?	
FormID: 0002D413	MG01Destruct	Recommendation	0	Oh, yes. You still need that, don't you? Well, are you ready to take care of that matter for me now?	
FormID: 000473F3	MG01Destruct	Recommendation	0	Adrienne is in charge. You'll need to speak to her about it, if you can tear her away from her latest book.	
FormID: 000473F4	MG01Destruct	Recommendation	0	Oh no, that's Adrienne's job, not mine. If you ask about it, don't be surprised if she's annoyed. She doesn't like being interrupted.	
FormID: 000473F5	MG01Destruct	Recommendation	0	Adrienne Berene is the person you're looking for. I'm sure she'll be more than happy to help you.	extremely sarcastic
FormID: 000174B8	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	Let me know if you find anything unusual in Falcar's quarters. I'd look myself, but it's locked, and I don't have the key.	
FormID: 000174B8	MG02Alter	Recommendation	1	You do, however. I believe the key he used for the well should also work on his quarters.	
FormID: 000174F3	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	I'll admit, it's my doing. I couldn't leave well enough alone, and after you'd left to go after that ring, well...	
FormID: 000174F3	MG02Alter	Recommendation	1	I'm just so tired of the way we've all been treated by Falcar! I was worried about you, and angry about Vidkun, so I confronted Falcar directly.	
FormID: 000174F3	MG02Alter	Recommendation	2	He was furious when I told him I'd helped you, and then when I threatened to report him to the Council of Mages, I thought he was going to kill me!	
FormID: 000174F3	MG02Alter	Recommendation	3	He flew into a rage! I didn't even understand some of his ranting, but he said that our days are numbered, and then he stormed out!	
FormID: 000174F3	MG02Alter	Recommendation	4	I don't know if he ever wrote your recommendation. I'm sorry. I didn't expect this to happen. Perhaps you should go look and see if he did write one?	
FormID: 000174F3	MG02Alter	Recommendation	5	You should check his room in the living quarters. If you see the note, or anything else unusual, let me know. I'll gladly send it to the Council.	typo
FormID: 000175B0	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	Just perform the task you've been given. We'll talk more once you're done.	
FormID: 0002E5E5	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	We can talk, so long as Falcar is out of earshot. If I didn't know any better, I'd say he's trying to get you killed!	
FormID: 0002E5E5	MG02Alter	Recommendation	1	He gave poor Vidkun the same task, and we never saw him again. I'm reasonably sure there's a connection, but I can't prove it.	
FormID: 0002E5E5	MG02Alter	Recommendation	2	Do be careful. I'd hate to lose another useful Associate.	
FormID: 0002E5E5	MG02Alter	Recommendation	3	Here's the key, and something extra. I don't know if it will be of use to you, but from what I've heard of Falcar's ring, it may come in handy.	
FormID: 0002E5E5	MG02Alter	Recommendation	4	And if you find out anything about what happened to Vidkun, let me know, will you?	
FormID: 0002E5E6	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	As I've said, I just don't feel comfortable talking to you about Falcar. Forgive me.	
FormID: 0002E5E7	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	Don't tell me Falcar's given you the same task he gave Vidkun!	
FormID: 0002E5E7	MG02Alter	Recommendation	1	Oh, dear. I'd say more, but... well, Falcar is the ranking member here, and I don't feel comfortable talking about him. I'm sorry.	
FormID: 0002E5E7	MG02Alter	Recommendation	2	I'll tell you what. Find me when Falcar's not around, and then we'll talk. After we've spoken, you can have the key. Believe me, this is important.	hushed; intended for player's ears only
FormID: 0002E5A3	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	I believe I explained your task very clearly. Find the ring, which is somewhere down in the well behind the guild hall. Bring it to me.	
FormID: 0002E5A3	MG02Alter	Recommendation	1	Do you understand, or do I need to use even smaller words?	
FormID: 0002E5A5	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	What, you think you're ready now?	
FormID: 0002E5A7	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	Don't waste my time if you're not ready for this. Are you prepared to do what is necessary to gain a recommendation from me?	
FormID: 000175B1	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	You'd better speak to Deetsan about it.	
FormID: 0002D272	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	Now that sounds like an odd way to prove your worth. I just don't understand Falcar sometimes.	
FormID: 0002D272	MG02Alter	Recommendation	1	The last Associate that came in for training never came back. I guess Falcar really upset him. Deetsan seemed mad about it, too.	
FormID: 000175B5	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	Didn't you hear? Oh, no. I suppose you wouldn't have.	
FormID: 000175B5	MG02Alter	Recommendation	1	You'd best go see Deetsan before you do anything else.	
FormID: 000175B6	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	Falcar always has been pretty harsh, even when it comes to basic lessons. He seems to have gotten worse lately, though.	
FormID: 000175B6	MG02Alter	Recommendation	1	I think he even scared away the last Associate who came here for training. What was his name again?	
FormID: 000175B6	MG02Alter	Recommendation	2	Hmm, I can't remember. Deetsan would know, though.	
FormID: 000175B7	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	There may be some... changes. I can't say for sure; you should talk to Deetsan.	
FormID: 0002D2A1	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	It sure sounds like Falcar has it in for you. What a bizarre thing to ask you to do!	
FormID: 000175B9	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	I think perhaps you should speak to Deetsan.	
FormID: 0002D2E4	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	Falcar gives out the strangest assignments sometimes. It's as if he doesn't really care about them.	
FormID: 0004A248	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	I'm afraid you'll have to speak to Falcar about that. 	
FormID: 0004A249	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	That's Falcar's responsibility. He takes it very seriously.	
FormID: 0004A24A	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	You'll have to get one from Falcar, if you can.	
FormID: 0004A24B	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	That would be Falcar's responsibility. Good luck.	
FormID: 0004A24C	MG02Alter	Recommendation	0	You'll need to see Falcar about that.	
FormID: 0002FD6D	MG04Restore	Recommendation	0	This is a harsh, dangerous task for you, I realize. Your unfamiliar face makes you most useful, however.	
FormID: 0002FD6D	MG04Restore	Recommendation	1	And, what better way to learn the many uses of Restoration? Practical application is often the best educator. Even in life and death situations.	REC
FormID: 00053239	MG04Restore	Recommendation	0	Are you prepared now? I have little time to waste.	
FormID: 0002EE40	MG04Restore	Recommendation	0	Unlike some frivolous tasks you may be given at other guild halls, this is a serious matter, and has consequences. Are you prepared?	
FormID: 0002F1F6	MG03Illusion	Recommendation	0	If you want it, you'll need to persuade Varon Vamori, using whatever means necessary, to return that staff.	
FormID: 0004CFAE	MG03Illusion	Recommendation	0	Are you so eager to begin? Very well. We can start, if you feel you are ready.

FormID: 00015F23	TG05Misdirection	TGHieronymusLex	1	I have one last task for you. As a sign of good faith, the Thieves Guild needs to return Hrormir's Icestaff to the Arcane University.	
FormID: 00015F23	TG05Misdirection	TGHieronymusLex	2	However, the wizards are not to be trusted. I'm sure they are watching for us to put it back where you got it.	
FormID: 00015F23	TG05Misdirection	TGHieronymusLex	3	They would have no qualms about killing you once they had the Icestaff back.	
FormID: 00015F23	TG05Misdirection	TGHieronymusLex	4	Instead, I want you to put Hrormir's Icestaff into Ontus Vanin's safe chest. He keeps one in his home. Ontus is a former University researcher.	
FormID: 00015F25	TG05Misdirection	TGHieronymusLex	0	Hieronymus Lex is no longer searching on the Waterfront? This is good. It's too bad you slew innocents to make it happen.

FormID: 00033EF6	MS46	MS46GoblinWar	1	I'd like to just believe you, but I can't send these people back to Cropsford unless I'm sure the goblin war is over.	
FormID: 00033EF6	MS46	MS46GoblinWar	2	Show me the head, so I know it is safe for the settlers to return to Cropsford.	
FormID: 0002F477	MS46	MS46GoblinWar	0	Like I told you, there are only two ways to stop a goblin war.	
FormID: 0002F477	MS46	MS46GoblinWar	1	Either kill the attacking tribe's shaman, or recover the [QUOTE]tribal head[QUOTE] from the rival tribe, which is likely the cause of the war.	
FormID: 0002F477	MS46	MS46GoblinWar	2	Neither one sounds like a picnic to me.	
FormID: 0002F521	MS46	MS46GoblinWar	0	Good work ending the goblin war. The settlers are very pleased. I'm pretty impressed as well.	
FormID: 0002F810	MS46	MS46GoblinWar	0	You took care of the goblin menace? That's great news, my friend!	
FormID: 0002F810	MS46	MS46GoblinWar	1	Now we can get back to building our new lives at Cropsford! Please, be sure to come visit us in a month or so. You have earned a hero's welcome!	
FormID: 0000AB69	MS46	MS46GoblinLairs	0	The two nearest are Timberscar Cave and Cracked Wood Cave. Here, I've marked them on your map. Unfortunately Cropsford is right in between them.	
FormID: 0000B227	Charactergen	CharGenRenote	0	I warned you to stay out of our way.	
FormID: 0000B226	Charactergen	CharGenRenote	0	Prisoner, I don't have time for your games. Do that again and die.	
FormID: 0000B225	Charactergen	CharGenRenote	0	Don't give me a reason to kill you.	
FormID: 0001D034	MS29	Inventory	0	I have disposed of all of my ill-gotten merchandise, and replaced it with more expensive, but carefully obtained items.	
FormID: 0001D035	MS29	Inventory	0	I don't even want to look at it for another moment...	
FormID: 0000BCA1	MS29	Inventory	0	What about my inventory?	
FormID: 0001D03A	MS29	Inventory	0	I am pleased that Thoronir has decided to donate his inventory to the temple. At least he is trying to make amends.	
FormID: 0001D03B	MS29	Inventory	0	To think, all of those items on Thoronir's shelves were only recently buried. Such blasphemy.	
FormID: 0000BCA3	MS29	Inventory	0	His inventory must be stolen. It has to be. He prices less than it costs to make some of those things. Go see for yourself.	
FormID: 0001D04A	MS29	Inventory	0	Inventory? I am a simple trapper. My inventory just consists of pelts and skins. I would hardly call that inventory. Now get outta my way.	
FormID: 0000BCA2	MS29	MS29ThoronirBad	0	I'm the chairperson for the Society of Concerned Merchants. We formed this group a while back to keep a nice fair economic balance in town.	
FormID: 0000BCA2	MS29	MS29ThoronirBad	1	Not every store is a member, but we're slowly trying to convince them to join. Everything was fine until Thoronir opened his shop nearby.	
FormID: 0000BCA2	MS29	MS29ThoronirBad	2	Selling all sorts of merchandise, he undercuts prices like you wouldn't believe. He doesn't always sell what we sell, but it is still a problem.	
FormID: 0000BCA2	MS29	MS29ThoronirBad	3	People who buy tend to want to spend their money there. That leaves none for us. It's getting so bad, a few of us may have to close up shop.	
FormID: 0000BCA2	MS29	MS29ThoronirBad	4	He outright refuses to join the Society or even discuss the matter. We are convinced he is up to no good.	
FormID: 0000BCA2	MS29	MS29ThoronirBad	5	What we need is for you to case his establishment, and figure out where he gets his inventory. Find some proof of his wrongdoing, and let us know.	
FormID: 0000BCA2	MS29	MS29ThoronirBad	6	We cannot do it ourselves, as he recognizes all of us. The job pays a fair bounty in gold when he is brought to justice.	
FormID: 0000BD5A	TG06Atonement	TG06WhereTaken	0	I don't know. She took the Argonian less than an hour ago though. He put up quite a struggle. He was bleeding all over the place.	
FormID: 0000BD59	TG06Atonement	TG06PaleLady	0	Every few days she comes for one of us. Some return, some don't. Those that are taken three times never return.	
FormID: 0000BD59	TG06Atonement	TG06PaleLady	1	This was Theranis' third time.	Do NOT record. The voice is correct. I had to make a small spelling change.
FormID: 00010503	TG06Atonement	TG06PaleLady	0	Mina? You don't want to go asking about her. She... um... interviews prisoners. She isn't one to be crossed.	
FormID: 00015321	TG06Atonement	TG06PaleLady	0	Filthy vampire! She took my cellmate Theranis a few days ago. If it hadn't been for you, I would have been next.	
FormID: 0000BED8	FGC10Swamp	StrangeLights	0	They started appearing a few nights ago. Odd, flickering lights. In the morning, there was nothing to see. But they were there at night.	
FormID: 0000BED9	FGC10Swamp	StrangeLights	0	Some have said they're will-o-the-wisps, though I've never heard of one killing a full-grown man.	
FormID: 0000BEDA	FGC10Swamp	StrangeLights	0	They were seen around the Swampy Cave. Strange, moving lights. I've never seen anything like it. Old-timers have tales about such things.	
FormID: 0000BEDB	FGC10Swamp	StrangeLights	0	I saw them a few nights ago. Very odd.	
FormID: 0000BEDC	FGC10Swamp	StrangeLights	0	I don't know you well enough to talk about that.	
FormID: 0006B31C	FGC10Swamp	disappearances	0	Horrible, just horrible. Those poor people.	REC
FormID: 0000BE71	FGC10Swamp	disappearances	0	You should ask Drarana Thelis about that.	
FormID: 0000BE6A	FGC10Swamp	disappearances	0	Oh, no! You believe trolls killed them? That's horrible. Good that you've killed all of the trolls, though. Please, take this, with our gratitude.	
FormID: 0000BE6C	FGC10Swamp	disappearances	0	Oh, no! You believe trolls killed them? That's horrible. Please, if you can kill all of those trolls, we'd greatly appreciate it.	
FormID: 0000BE6D	FGC10Swamp	disappearances	0	Will O' the Wisps? I've never heard of them killing a man! Please, find out what happened to our friends. We're counting on your help.	
FormID: 0000BE70	FGC10Swamp	disappearances	0	Some folks reported seeing strange lights near the old Swampy Cave. We sent folks to investigate them, but haven't seen them since. We need help.	
FormID: 0000BE73	FGC10Swamp	disappearances	0	Trolls, huh? And drawn in by will-o-the-wisps? There's some lousy luck for you. Well, here's your payment.	
FormID: 0000BE73	FGC10Swamp	disappearances	1	Afraid to say, I don't have any more contracts for you. I don't think Azzan has any, either. You did pretty good work, meat.	
FormID: 0000BE74	FGC10Swamp	disappearances	0	Trolls, huh? And drawn in by will-o-the-wisps? There's some lousy luck for you. Well, here's your payment.	
FormID: 0000BE74	FGC10Swamp	disappearances	1	Afraid to say, I don't have any more contracts for you. Maybe Azzan has some, but I don't know. You did pretty good work, meat.	
FormID: 0000BEA5	FGC10Swamp	disappearances	0	Some folks are missing in Harlun's Watch. We've been contracted to find out what's happened. Speak to Drarana Thelis for all the details. Get going.	
FormID: 0000BE77	FGC09Ogres	LadyRogbutTOPIC	0	Please, rescue my daughter from those brutes! I fear for her safe return!	
FormID: 0000BE79	FGC09Ogres	LadyRogbutTOPIC	0	I fear that whilst out rock-picking, she was apprehensive. Stolen away! My suspension is that ogres have abjected her! 	
FormID: 0000BE79	FGC09Ogres	LadyRogbutTOPIC	1	Please search to the east of my sprawling abode. They have been known to vacate these premises. I am most gracious and truly woeful.	
FormID: 0000BE7E	FGC09Ogres	LadyRogbutTOPIC	0	You got her back in one piece? Good work! I've always liked that girl. May have to look her up sometime. Here's your payment.	
FormID: 0000BEA4	FGC09Ogres	LadyRogbutTOPIC	0	A fine model of an Orcish woman. Now go find her. And don't be rude, or she'll rip your ears off.	
FormID: 0000BE7D	FGC09Ogres	LordRugdumphTOPIC	0	He's an Orcish noble. A fine man. Our families go back a bit. Anyway, his daughter is missing.	
FormID: 0000BE7D	FGC09Ogres	LordRugdumphTOPIC	1	Head to his estate and talk to him. Find his daughter. And mind your manners! I don't want you embarassing me!	
FormID: 0000BE82	FGC09Ogres	LordRugdumphTOPIC	0	I am Lord Rugdumph gro-Shurgak. How may I persist you?	
FormID: 0000BEEB	MG12Gate	MG12Choice1B	0	Better that you should be adequately prepared. I shall await your return.	
FormID: 0000BEFD	MG12Gate	MG12Choice1A	0	Very good. Let me explain what is at stake.	
FormID: 0000BEFD	MG12Gate	MG12Choice1A	1	The Council of Mages has been aware of the increased Necromancer activity in Cyrodiil for some time.	
FormID: 0000BEFD	MG12Gate	MG12Choice1A	2	It had been our position to sit back and watch what unfolded, but that time has clearly passed. We cannot tolerate these attacks on the guild.	
FormID: 0000BEFD	MG12Gate	MG12Choice1A	3	Most of our information on the Necromancers has come from an informant inside the cult itself, a guild member who offered to infiltrate their ranks.	
FormID: 0000BF93	TG06Atonement	TG06WhereIsShum	0	He doesn't leave Castle Skingrad often. At ten he heads over to the West Weald Inn. Then at noon he goes to the Colovian Trader.	
FormID: 0000BF94	TG06Atonement	TG06WhereIsShum	0	You mean other than at the Castle? Hmmm. He's around town at midday. Try the Colovian Trader and the West Weald Inn.	
FormID: 0000BF92	TG05Misdirection	TG05LexToMen	0	All right men. We've been ordered back to our posts. I smell the dirty hand of the Gray Fox behind this.	
FormID: 00015449	TG06Atonement	TG06NoBook	0	The prey escapes. Return when you have the book or know that Theranis will return with it.	
FormID: 00015448	TG06Atonement	TG06GiveBook	0	Theranis is dead? I grieve for him. But at least you have the book. The Gray Fox has sought this book for many years.	REC
FormID: 00015448	TG06Atonement	TG06GiveBook	1	All would be good if you had not killed to get it. The Thieves Guild has no use for you until you pay the blood price.	
FormID: 00015448	TG06Atonement	TG06GiveBook	2	I do not wish to set eyes on you until you can cleanse the guild's honor by paying blood price. Go now.	
FormID: 000174B9	TG06Atonement	TG06GiveBook	0	Theranis is dead? I grieve for him. But at least you have the book. The Gray Fox has sought this book for many years.	REC

FormID: 0000BF83	TG06Atonement	TG06BookLostHistories	0	He told me to give this message to any member of the Thieves Guild that asked about him or a book.	Do NOT rerecord. I changed grammar to match the audio.

FormID: 0000BF8A	TG06Atonement	TG06BookLostHistories	1	As soon as we are out of sight of the castle's main gate, I'll tell you.	
FormID: 0000BF89	TG06Atonement	TG06Trespassing	0	We have a... situation. The Count has sent most of the servants home. You have to leave. Sorry, but you ain't working here anymore either.	
FormID: 0000BF88	TG06Atonement	TG06RefuseJob	0	I'm not surprised. Nobody wants that job. Let me know if you change your mind. It will probably still be available.	
FormID: 0000BF87	TG06Atonement	TG06TakeJob	0	You will?! I mean, good! Mind your manners in the castle. Stay out of Count Hassildor's quarters. And don't let me catch you in the wine cellar!	
FormID: 0000BF87	TG06Atonement	TG06TakeJob	1	The jail guards in the dungeon will unlock the cell block door if you ask them. Feed the prisoners once a day. I don't care when.	
FormID: 0000BF84	TG06Atonement	TG06CastleJobs	0	I need someone to slop food to the prisoners. I'll pay you 2 gold a week, plus half a loaf of bread and a glass of mead each day.	
FormID: 0000BF84	TG06Atonement	TG06CastleJobs	1	I'm having trouble hiring these days, so if you want the job it's yours.	
FormID: 0000BF86	TG06Atonement	TG06CastleJobs	0	I heard that Shum gro-Yarug is looking to hire. He's the butler for the Count. Go speak to him.	
FormID: 0000BF95	TG06Atonement	TG06CastleJobs	0	They sometimes need folks to work in the castle. Most are afraid to go up there though. Try asking the butler, Shum gro-Yarug.	
FormID: 0000C01A	TG07Lex	TG07ForgeThisLetter	0	Hmm. Yes, it can be done. I can change it to give Lex the highest recommendation. I'll need a full day to properly forge this letter. Return then.	
FormID: 0000C01A	TG07Lex	TG07ForgeThisLetter	1	And of course I will expect payment in full at that time.	
FormID: 0000C018	TG07Lex	TG07reject	0	I am disappointed. When you are better prepared, return to me.	
FormID: 0000C019	TG07Lex	TG07accept	0	That is good. Remember, this is a mission of stealth, not blood. Your payment will be higher than normal to cover the expense of the forgery.

FormID: 0000C05D	TG05Misdirection	TG05WhatIsPlan	1	Your target is the Arcane University. We've had our eye on Hrormir's Staff for some time, but have been waiting for the wizards to be distracted.

FormID: 0000C05C	TG05Misdirection	TG05HowBad	0	Hieronymus Lex has vowed not to leave until the Gray Fox is in custody. The Fox is safe, but the Thieves Guild cannot do business like this.	
FormID: 0000C05C	TG05Misdirection	TG05HowBad	1	The poor of the Waterfront are kindred to the Gray Fox, and will not betray him. However, cubs soon get hungry. Soon someone will break.	
FormID: 0000C05C	TG05Misdirection	TG05HowBad	2	Many guild members could be jailed. Find Methredhel in the Imperial City. She is co-ordinating the guild's response.	REC   I added a wrong word, which has been deleted.

FormID: 0000C049	TG07Lex	TG07WhyNotKillLex	1	For reasons unknown to this one, the Gray Fox has extended his protection to the Umbranox family and Lady Umbranox in particular.	
FormID: 0000C049	TG07Lex	TG07WhyNotKillLex	2	While Lex is a problem for the guild, his unwavering loyalty and resolve make him the perfect protector for Lady Umbranox.

FormID: 0000C1CE	MS31	BlackwaterBrigands	0	Well, I'm afraid all of this was my fault. They hijacked the Bloated Float because of me. Business has been waning of late, so I invented a story.	
FormID: 0000C1CE	MS31	BlackwaterBrigands	1	I fashioned a tale about a [QUOTE]Golden Galleon[QUOTE] that the previous owner hid within this very vessel. It was to be a statuette made completely of gold.	
FormID: 0000C1CE	MS31	BlackwaterBrigands	2	At the time, the idea was quite clever, I thought. I figured the lore would draw more curiosity seekers and adventurers looking for the treasure.	
FormID: 0000C1CE	MS31	BlackwaterBrigands	3	What could the harm be if while they were here, they bought a drink or two? My business has increased quite a bit since I leaked the story.

FormID: 00012103	SE06	SE06KanehMirel	0	Too risky. It's likely to be a trap. They could cut us to pieces down there if they knew we were coming.	
FormID: 00012CBC	SE06	SE06KanehMirel	0	With all due respect, Aurmazl, I ask that you reconsider. The main passage is strongly defended. Perhaps if you'd allow me to scout further...	
FormID: 00012104	SE06	SE06KanehMirel	0	Enough! I've made my decision. We will attack down the main passage, as planned. The Mazken will not withstand us!	
FormID: 00012CD0	SE06	SE06HelpAttackA3B3	0	That's why females command and males take orders. Come. Let us surrender to the madness of battle!

FormID: 00012CD2	SE06	SE06HelpAttackA5	0	You're making a mistake. There is no other way to light the Flame.	
FormID: 00012CD2	SE06	SE06HelpAttackA5	1	If you think the Mazken will help you, you will be disappointed. We will destroy them with or without your help.	
FormID: 00012CD2	SE06	SE06HelpAttackA5	2	Go then. I will hold off on my attack to give you a chance to reconsider. But I will not wait forever.	
FormID: 00012CD1	SE06	SE06HelpAttackA4	0	That's an excellent idea. They cannot refuse entry to an emissary of Lord Sheogorath.	
FormID: 00012CD1	SE06	SE06HelpAttackA4	1	Return at once when you have their deployments. This could make all the difference.	
FormID: 00012CCD	SE06	SE06HelpAttackA3	0	Are all males so obstinate? Have I not already told you that I consider that route too risky?	
FormID: 00012CCD	SE06	SE06HelpAttackA3	1	What makes you think you can persuade me when my own lieutenant cannot?	
FormID: 00018F9B	SE06	SE06HelpAttackA3	0	I've already made my decision. We attack down the main passage!	
FormID: 00018F9B	SE06	SE06HelpAttackA3	1	What makes you think you can persuade me when my own lieutenant cannot?	
FormID: 00012CCC	SE06	SE06HelpAttackA2	0	Very good, Emissary. With your help, we will rid Cylarne of the Mazken once and for all!	
FormID: 00012CCA	SE06	SE06HelpAttackA1	0	Ah, Mirel's beloved surprise attack. A perfect example of why males do not hold command positions.	
FormID: 00012CCA	SE06	SE06HelpAttackA1	1	He has failed to consider the risks of his plan. If the Mazken have prepared an ambush along that route, we would be slaughtered.	
FormID: 00012CCA	SE06	SE06HelpAttackA1	2	We're better off storming the main passage, where our superior strength and bladework can come into play.	
FormID: 00012CC9	SE06	SE06HelpAttack	0	The only way to assault the Altar of Despair is down the main passage between the two altars.	
FormID: 00012CC9	SE06	SE06HelpAttack	1	It will be difficult. The Mazken have fortified their position. But I am confident that with your help, we can defeat them.	
FormID: 00012CC9	SE06	SE06HelpAttack	2	Will you help us retake the Altar of Despair, and drive the Mazken out of Cylarne once and for all?	
FormID: 00012CCB	SE06	SE06HelpAttack	0	Are you ready to help us destroy the Mazken and take control of the Altar of Despair?	
FormID: 000131B4	SE06	SE06FlameAgnon	0	The two Altars, blessed Despair and holy Rapture, feed the great Flame of Agnon above us.	
FormID: 000131B4	SE06	SE06FlameAgnon	1	Only Sheogorath's immortal servants can kindle the Altars, and I am at my Lord's command. But I only hold Despair... for the moment.	
FormID: 000131B4	SE06	SE06FlameAgnon	2	The Aureals hold Rapture, and are massing to attack us. But never fear, they are no match for us.	
FormID: 000131B4	SE06	SE06FlameAgnon	3	Once their main force is destroyed, with your help, we can easily take Rapture from the few survivors. Then, I will gladly kindle the Flame for you.	
FormID: 000131AC	SE06	SE06FlameAgnon	0	Only the servants of Sheogorath can light the Flame, by kindling the Altars of Despair and Rapture which feed the Flame.	
FormID: 000131AC	SE06	SE06FlameAgnon	1	Alas, we hold only the Altar of Rapture. The treacherous Mazken hold the Altar of Despair. We must control both to light the Flame.	
FormID: 000131AC	SE06	SE06FlameAgnon	2	If you help us seize the Altar of Despair from the Mazken, I will be honored to kindle the Flame of Agnon for my Lord Sheogorath.	
FormID: 00012CC8	SE06	SE06FlameAgnon	0	The Flame is fed from the Altar of Rapture and the Altar of Despair. Only servants of Sheogorath can kindle the Altars.	
FormID: 00012CC8	SE06	SE06FlameAgnon	1	Once we capture the Altar of Despair from the Mazken, it will be my great honor to light the Flame for Lord Sheogorath.	
FormID: 0003E6A5	SE06	SE06FlameAgnon	0	Only the immortal servants of Sheogorath can kindle the Altars of Despair and Rapture, which in turn feed the holy Flame of Agnon.	
FormID: 0003E6A5	SE06	SE06FlameAgnon	1	Once the Aureals are routed from the Altar of Rapture, I will be most pleased to command my soldiers to light the Flame for Sheogorath's glory.	
FormID: 0003E6AD	SE06	SE06FlameAgnon	0	The holy Flame can only be lit from the Altars of Despair and Rapture. Alas, the Aureals hold Rapture... for now.	
FormID: 0003E6AD	SE06	SE06FlameAgnon	1	You should speak to the Grakedrig Ulfri at once. She will be glad of your help to rid Cylarne of the arrogant Aureals once and for all.	
FormID: 0003E6AF	SE06	SE06FlameAgnon	0	The Flame is only lit at the command of Sheogorath, from the Altars of Rapture and Despair within the Shrine itself.	
FormID: 0003E6AF	SE06	SE06FlameAgnon	1	I'm sure the Aurmazl Kaneh will be glad to help you once the Mazken are driven from the Altar of Despair.	
FormID: 00012CC1	SE06	SEAureals	0	That's what we call ourselves. The most loyal and honorable servants of Sheogorath.	
FormID: 00012CC2	SE06	SEAureals	0	Our rivals. The so-called Golden Saints. One day, Sheogorath will finally recognize their bull-headed stupidity and expel them from the Realm.	
FormID: 00012CC3	SE06	SEMazken	0	The treacherous ones: the Dark Seducers of ill-repute, whose every action drags Sheogorath's holy name through the mud.	
FormID: 00012CC4	SE06	SEMazken	0	You know us as Dark Seducers. A name given us by our enemies. But we are the Mazken in our own tongue, Sheogorath's only truly loyal servants.	
FormID: 00012CBF	SE06	SE06MaikiChoiceB	0	I knew it! You should tell Kaneh what you saw. Maybe you can convince her to change her attack plan.	
FormID: 00012CBE	SE06	SE06MaikiChoiceA	0	She thinks the Underdeep is a trap. It's true, if the Mazken knew we were coming that way, we wouldn't stand a chance.	
FormID: 00012CBE	SE06	SE06MaikiChoiceA	1	But I'm convinced the Mazken don't expect us to come that way.	
FormID: 00012CBE	SE06	SE06MaikiChoiceA	2	If we attacked in full force, we could take the Altar of Despair before they had a chance to react.	
FormID: 00012CBE	SE06	SE06MaikiChoiceA	3	If only I could make Kaneh see that.	
FormID: 00012CBD	SE06	SE06SidePassage	0	My scouts recently discovered another way through the ruins to the Altar of Despair.	
FormID: 00012CBD	SE06	SE06SidePassage	1	The Aurmazl Kaneh wants to assault the altar down the main passage, but the Mazken are expecting us to come that way.	
FormID: 00012CBD	SE06	SE06SidePassage	2	They've strongly fortified the main passage against us. If we attacked through the Underdeep, we could take them by surprise.	
FormID: 00012CBD	SE06	SE06SidePassage	3	If only Kaneh would listen to me. An attack down the main passage will end the same as it always does -- a glorious defeat.	
FormID: 00012D1D	SE32	SE32WelkyndStones	0	The sacred stones! You've desecrated them with your touch. You're on the list for sure now.	Shocked.
FormID: 00012D1D	SE32	SE32WelkyndStones	1	I would never have allowed myself to do that. However, now that they are befouled, I can use them. You may grovel in gratitude at my feet later.	Stunned. Second sentence is scheming. Last sentence is megalomaniac again.
FormID: 00012D1C	SE32	SE32MagicDagger	0	Yes! Yes! I can use this to charge my magicka. All I need is a source...someone nearby...someone with magicka. Someone on the list!	Megalomaniac

FormID: 00012D1E	SE32	SE32HlovalsMagicka	0	Hloval healed my betrothed once. Then he ran out of magic. He said he needed to find someone to lend him some before he could help her more.	Grateful, then turns sad.
FormID: 00012D20	SE32	SE32HlovalsMagicka	0	Problem? I supose you think that everyone with stunted magicka has a [QUOTE]problem.[QUOTE] You're nothing but a bigot. You're on the list now.	Last sentence is [QUOTE]I'll get you[QUOTE] attitude.
FormID: 000135CF	SE32	SE32HlovalsMagicka	0	Hloval dances a little too close to Sheogorath, if you know what I mean. Those born with stunted magicka shouldn't become priests and healers.	[QUOTE]that poor man[QUOTE] attitude
FormID: 0005A754	SE32	SE32HlovalsMagicka	0	It was an honor for me to help Prior Dreth. The pain of the stab wound was a small sacrifice to restore his magicka.	Hero worship.
FormID: 0008EFD0	SE32	SE32HlovalsMagicka	0	Hloval's treachery is second only to my cowardice. My curse will not allow me to help you with his need.	The anger is shadowed with world-weary.

FormID: 00012D03	SE32	SE32Betrothed	0	She's in the hands of the Fanatics! I must save her. Stand back, stranger. I need room to swing my sword.	Starts out as fear, changes to righteous anger
FormID: 00012D0F	SE32	SE32Betrothed	0	You mean that stupid doll? I think he's been blessed a little too well by Lord Sheogorath. He's on the list. Not first though. Definitely not first.	Last three sentences are irritated (mild anger)
FormID: 00012D10	SE32	SE32Betrothed	0	0, 9. Ah, the doll. Poor Desideratus. 1, 5. Fanatics killed his whole family. 9, 6.  That doll is all he has left of them. 5, 5, 9, 4.	Sympathetic. The counting should be quick and almost under her breath. It's almost as if she isn't even aware she's doing it.
FormID: 000948B0	SE32	SE32Betrothed	0	My Beloved! I'll carry her away to safety. Should the fanatics get her, I...I...I would have to kill them all.	
FormID: 00012D1F	SE32	SE32Betrothed	0	She is the love of my life. I would do anything to save her.	Obssessed.
FormID: 000135D0	SE32	SE32Betrothed	0	Desideratus is a little too attached to that doll, if you know what I mean. They don't like to dance. It gives me the creeps. 	
FormID: 0008EFD1	SE32	SE32Betrothed	0	Desideratus is a gentle fool. I never should have allowed him to take up the sword. My curse will not allow me to help you with his need.	Fatherly regret.

FormID: 00012D05	SE32	SE32WhatCanIDo	2	You can put away your sword in these halls. Unlike the defending spirits, within these walls, none will war with you. Not even the Fanatics.	Grateful
FormID: 00012D06	SE32	SE32Challenge	0	Arrogant fool! I curse you to remain trapped here with the shades of my people.	
FormID: 00012D06	SE32	SE32Challenge	1	As we are doomed to eternally relive the last moments of our failed attempts to save our keep, so shall you eternally watch us.	
FormID: 00012D04	SE32	SE32OfferHelp	0	Wisely answered. My people and I are in need. Maybe you can help us.	Calm and hopeful
FormID: 00012D04	SE32	SE32OfferHelp	1	Centuries ago, Vitharn was overrun by Fanatics. We were soft and failed to defend ourselves. I was the weakest of all.	wistful
FormID: 00012D04	SE32	SE32OfferHelp	2	Now, the shades of my people are cursed by Sheogorath to repeat the final moments of their failures, over and over again.	Regret
FormID: 000131B9	SE06	SE06HelpDefendA4	0	As you wish. But I advise you to join the winning side if you really want the Flame relit. The Aureals will never drive us from Cylarne.	
FormID: 000131B8	SE06	SE06HelpDefendA2	0	I never suspected that Kaneh had the audacity to try such a risky assault.	
FormID: 000131B8	SE06	SE06HelpDefendA2	1	But we'll teach her to try to take the Mazken by surprise! We'll cut them to pieces in those corridors! I'll redeploy my forces at once.	
FormID: 000131B8	SE06	SE06HelpDefendA2	2	You return to Kaneh and lead her into the trap. Once they are destroyed, I will kindle the Altars. Good hunting, friend.	
FormID: 000131B7	SE06	SE06HelpDefendA1	0	This will be a glorious day! Cylarne will finally be free of the Aureals. Follow me. We're expecting the attack at any moment.	
FormID: 00018F8B	SE06	SE06HelpDefend	0	I have ordered my troops to deploy into the Underdeep. Your job is to lead the Aureals into our trap. Don't worry, we'll be ready for them.	
FormID: 000131B5	SE06	SE06HelpDefend	0	We are expecting the Aureals to attack any moment. They'll come down the main passage from the Altar of Rapture. They always do.	
FormID: 000131B5	SE06	SE06HelpDefend	1	They are overconfident, as usual. We have prepared many traps and ambushes. It will be a glorious slaughter.	
FormID: 000131B5	SE06	SE06HelpDefend	2	Once the Aureals are destroyed, I will light the Flame of Agnon for you. Will you help us defend the Altar of Despair?	
FormID: 000131B6	SE06	SE06HelpDefend	0	Are you ready to help us defend the Altar of Despair from the Aureals' attack?	
FormID: 000131B3	SE06	SE06UlfriGreetA2	0	Then you have arrived just in time to help us defend the Altar of Despair.	
FormID: 000131B3	SE06	SE06UlfriGreetA2	1	Once the strength of the Aureals is shattered, I will be honored to light the Flame as my Lord Sheogorath commands.	
FormID: 000131B2	SE06	SE06UlfriGreetA1	0	We are preparing to wipe out the arrogant Aureals once and for all.	
FormID: 000131B2	SE06	SE06UlfriGreetA1	1	Once they break themselves on our defenses, Cylarne will be ours, a gift for our Lord Sheogorath.	
FormID: 0003E6B7	SE06	SE06GreetB1	0	The Flame is lit from the Shrine's two Altars. Once the Aureals are driven out of Cylarne, it will be our pleasure to light the Flame for Sheogorath.	
FormID: 0003E6B7	SE06	SE06GreetB1	1	The Grakedrig Ulfri will explain everything. You should speak to her at once.	
FormID: 0003E6BB	SE06	SE06GreetB1	0	Alas, we cannot light the Flame until we take control of the Altar of Despair from the infernal Mazken.	
FormID: 0003E6BB	SE06	SE06GreetB1	1	The Aurmazl Kaneh would wish to speak to you at once. Proceed through this door to our main encampment at the Altar of Rapture.	
FormID: 000131AB	SE06	SE06KanehGreetA	0	My pardon, Emissary. I am at your service.	
FormID: 000131AB	SE06	SE06KanehGreetA	1	We are preparing to sweep the Mazken scum from Cylarne. Perhaps Sheogorath sent you to help us?	
FormID: 00082470	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	0	The Chalice is one of the Duke's prized possessions. He has been at a loss without it.	
FormID: 00043021	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	0	The Chalice has altered the effects that Felldew has on you. You'll find that it now provides minor benefits, without any of the withdrawal.	
FormID: 00043022	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	0	Do you really require help in finding it at this point? I suspect you can manage on your own from here.	
FormID: 0001E3FE	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	0	Thadon's problem. Not mine.	
FormID: 0001E401	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	0	Not my place to talk about it. You need to know, you talk to Wide-Eye.	
FormID: 0001344B	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	0	I've told you what I will. The Chalice is a corruption. Felldew is a poison, not an amusement. You're better off leaving the Chalice where it is.	
FormID: 00018B7B	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	0	You think I care for Thadon's toys? It matters not to me whether he suffers in agony, or erases his mind with drugs.	
FormID: 00018B7B	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	1	But if you insist... Do you know the lengths of his depravity? How low he stoops to pursue his pathetic lifestyle?	
FormID: 00018B7B	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	2	Felldew is a poison. It kills. And yet Thadon uses the Chalice he created to twist Felldew into a drug he takes for his own amusement. How sick.	
FormID: 00018B7B	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	3	If he were smart, he'd thank Sheogorath it's out of his hands now. And, of course, he'd never risk himself traveling through Dunroot Burrow to get it	
FormID: 0001344C	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	0	You want information from me? After what you put me through?	
FormID: 00019539	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	0	Why would you come to me with Thadon's problems? You think I don't know what you've been tasked with? Why would I help my enemy?	
FormID: 0001344D	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	0	You have the stink of Mania about you. Leave before I start vomiting.	
FormID: 00013384	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	0	The Chalice is in Dunroot Burrow. Haven't you been listening?	
FormID: 00013385	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	0	I don't ask too many questions of Thadon. It's precious to him, and that's all that matters. It's his own business.	
FormID: 00013385	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	1	But, didn't he mention where it is?	
FormID: 00013385	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	2	Oh... I see. How brilliant of him. This is for you as much as it is for him. Oh, very good Thadon!	
FormID: 00013385	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	3	Dunroot Burrow is your goal, my friend. And what a goal it is.	
FormID: 00013388	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	0	You don't understand. This isn't just about the Chalice. This is about you. We must discuss Dunroot Burrow.	
FormID: 00018B7D	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	0	I feel as though we've talked about this. Am I mistaken?	
FormID: 00018B7D	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	1	Perhaps you're mistaken, and we have spoken of it. I simply can't recall. I could think so much more clearly if I had the Chalice.	
FormID: 000131D9	SE04	SEChaliceofReversal	0	Oh, so you've heard of it?	
FormID: 00091D2D	SENQDMania	SEChaliceofReversal	0	Wonderful to have it back. Really, truly. I can't thank you enough. Oh, wait. I already did.	happy, absent-minded
FormID: 0008F178	SE10	SEThadonTopic	0	Our own Duke, aligned with the forces of Order? An infuriating thought!	
FormID: 0008F178	SE10	SEThadonTopic	1	He will suffer greatly at the hands of Lord Sheogorath.	
FormID: 0004301C	SE04	SEThadonTopic	0	Thadon has told you what he wants. Consider speaking with the others in his court, particularly his steward.	
FormID: 0004301F	SE04	SEThadonTopic	0	He is aware you are here, and should be waiting for you. See him at once.	
FormID: 00018B7C	SE04	SEThadonTopic	0	Is Thadon not waiting for you to return the Chalice? Go to him, then! Do not anger him, for then you risk angering me as well.	
FormID: 00013389	SE04	SEThadonTopic	0	If you are working to help Thadon, I'll tell you whatever I can.	
FormID: 0001338A	SE04	SEThadonTopic	0	Oh, you're helping him? Why didn't you say so?	
FormID: 0001338A	SE04	SEThadonTopic	1	I'd do anything for him. Anything at all. Eat my own young if he asked me to...	
FormID: 0001338A	SE04	SEThadonTopic	2	And then he... He goes and does... If I find out who she is, I'll tear her limb from limb!	
FormID: 0001338A	SE04	SEThadonTopic	3	But... You don't need to hear that. You need to know. You need to know what he's asked of you. The Chalice, yes?	
FormID: 000131D6	SE04	SEThadonTopic	0	I heard that you were coming, looking for Thadon. Yes, yes. Heard it all. Bored to tears by it.	
FormID: 000131D6	SE04	SEThadonTopic	1	He's waiting for you. Unless he isn't. He wasn't, but then he was. Maybe he still is.	
FormID: 00044F55	SE04Shell	SEThadonTopic	0	The long-reigning Duke of Mania. A Master of Merriment, if you will. Or if you won't; I suspect it wouldn't matter to him.	
FormID: 0008F176	SE10	SESylTopic	0	What reason could she have to turn on Lord Sheogorath Himself? She must know that He will find and punish her.	
FormID: 0008F176	SE10	SESylTopic	1	We will catch her, and will turn her over ourselves. Her treachery cannot be allowed to stand.	
FormID: 0008F177	SE10	SESylTopic	0	Our own Duchess, aligned with the forces of Order? An infuriating thought!	
FormID: 0008F177	SE10	SESylTopic	1	She will suffer greatly at the hands of Lord Sheogorath.	
FormID: 00044F56	SE04Shell	SESylTopic	0	The Duchess of Dementia. Ever wary, ever worried. A prisoner in her own House, in a way. And a delightful conversationalist, really.	
FormID: 00044F56	SE04Shell	SESylTopic	1	A bit harder to meet than Thadon. Consider making an appointment.	
FormID: 0004301E	SE04	SEDunrootBurrowTopic	0	I believe you've already been instructed as to how to proceed. You'll need to ingest Felldew to enter the Burrow.	
FormID: 0004301E	SE04	SEDunrootBurrowTopic	1	You've already been warned that this will weaken you, so do take the necessary precautions.	
FormID: 00013387	SE04	SEDunrootBurrowTopic	0	Go there. Take the Felldew from the Elytra, eat it, and your journey begins. You will be thankful to Thadon when this has passed.	
FormID: 0001338B	SE04	SEDunrootBurrowTopic	0	Yes, yes. A most unique place. Of course, the Chalice would be there! Don't you see? It's the Elytra. They're the reason.	
FormID: 0001338B	SE04	SEDunrootBurrowTopic	1	The Chalice, Felldew, Elytra... it's all connected. One without the others is no good, poison. Oh, a rough road awaits you.	
FormID: 0001338B	SE04	SEDunrootBurrowTopic	2	Some Elytra there are... different. You'll need to get Felldew from them, and eat it. Can't get in without it. But once you do...	
FormID: 0001338B	SE04	SEDunrootBurrowTopic	3	He wants you to learn for yourself. Learn, grow, experience. It's his way. I shouldn't say more. But the Burrow, it's northeast of New Sheoth.	
FormID: 000131D7	SE04	SEThadonWaitingDontCare	0	Don't I? I thought I did. But then I also thought that you would be heavier. Look at you, you're light as a chair. How DO you walk around like that?	
FormID: 000131D7	SE04	SEThadonWaitingDontCare	1	It's all the same to me, either way. All of it. Nothing is right without the Chalice. Have you ever used it? No, of course not. You simply must!	
FormID: 000131D7	SE04	SEThadonWaitingDontCare	2	You just have to try it. It'll change your world, expand your horizons. Contracting leads to expanding, you know. Well, most of the time.	
FormID: 000131D8	SE04	SEThadonWaitingForever	0	Yes, yes... That just might be true. Or I've not been waiting at all. Forever and nothing are almost the same thing, wouldn't you say?	
FormID: 000131D8	SE04	SEThadonWaitingForever	1	How do you tell one from another if you're smack in the middle? Don't answer that, I already know the answer of course. It came to me during a meal.	
FormID: 000131D8	SE04	SEThadonWaitingForever	2	Not a very good meal, though. Too much pie. Pie is a tricky thing, wouldn't you say? Don't answer that either.	
FormID: 000131D8	SE04	SEThadonWaitingForever	3	Now that forever is over and you're here, you need to go away. Yes, away. There are places you should be, far away from here.	
FormID: 000131D8	SE04	SEThadonWaitingForever	4	The Chalice of Reversal is waiting for you. When I say you, I mean me, but it's no difference to the Chalice. One ends up being the other.	
FormID: 000131DB	SE04	SEThadonWaitingShort	0	Haven't I? Hmm, perhaps not. It felt like rather a long time, but then long times get longer when you're standing around thinking about them.	
FormID: 000131DB	SE04	SEThadonWaitingShort	1	A curious thing, that. Long roads get longer too, if you're thinking about them, but what about long words? They don't change nearly as much.	
FormID: 000131DB	SE04	SEThadonWaitingShort	2	Long, short -- it all ends up the same. Dust and tears. Usually tears first, then the dust. Dust can't cry, you see. That would be... well, amusing.	
FormID: 000131DB	SE04	SEThadonWaitingShort	3	You know what's NOT amusing? I don't have my Chalice of Reversal. It makes me sad. When I get sad, I don't care to do much of anything.	
FormID: 000131DB	SE04	SEThadonWaitingShort	4	I certainly don't care to help people who show up on my doorstep wanting something. Are we getting the picture here?	
FormID: 000131DA	SE04	SEThadonWaitingLong	0	Oh, I wouldn't say that. How long is an eon, when you're ten thousand feet tall? Or if you're purple? It's all relative, you see.	
FormID: 000131DA	SE04	SEThadonWaitingLong	1	You wouldn't really know how long it's been, since you weren't here. If you'd been here, it would've been no time at all, so who's to say?	
FormID: 000131DA	SE04	SEThadonWaitingLong	2	Don't answer that. I know the answer. I knew far more answers once, but they seem to have dried up. Or perhaps they drowned. I don't know anymore.	
FormID: 000131DA	SE04	SEThadonWaitingLong	3	You see? You see what I have to deal with? I can't recall if I'm coming or you're going without the Chalice of Reversal. Oh, now you've upset me.	
FormID: 0001330B	SE04	SE04Who	0	We hold on to fleeting things even as we slip. I knew, and yet I indulged myself anyway. I indulged her a fair bit, too. Hee hee!	
FormID: 0001330B	SE04	SE04Who	1	It was passion, it was... forbidden. Oh, the things that would be said if word got out. That made it all the more delicious.	
FormID: 0001330B	SE04	SE04Who	2	From Dementia's own court, no less. Scandalous! Fatal, perhaps. But passion makes no accomodation for self-preservation.	
FormID: 00013309	SE04	SE04ChaliceNo	0	You haven't heard of it, yet you know its name? What a strange creature you are.	confused
FormID: 00013309	SE04	SE04ChaliceNo	1	One of my favorite toys. Does wonders for creativity. Well, not by itself, but it helps. Those Elytra, clever little bugs that they are.	
FormID: 00013309	SE04	SE04ChaliceNo	2	Is this making sense? Look, you eat the Felldew, then use the Chalice, and find the world a much brighter and happier place. Honest.	
FormID: 00013309	SE04	SE04ChaliceNo	3	But I don't have it. So I can't eat Felldew, because that would just be bad. I mean, really bad. Damn her!	
FormID: 0001330A	SE04	SE04ChaliceYes	0	Then you know why I want it back! Can you imagine trying to eat Felldew without it? Disastrous! Curse that woman!	
FormID: 00013344	SE32	SE32Arrows	0	So what you're saying is you really, really need these arrows? Go ahead. Take them. What would I want them for?	
FormID: 00013345	SE32	SE32Arrows	0	I can't give you any arrows because then the armory would be empty. Then what would I do if someone needed some arrows?	Talking like the listener is stupid
FormID: 00013345	SE32	SE32Arrows	1	I wouldn't have any, that's what. So these arrows are staying right here in case someone needs them.	Talking like the listener is stupid
FormID: 00013346	SE32	SE32Arrows	0	It's that fool Bat gro-Orkul. He thinks his armory is more important than the town or our lives. He's first on the list. Oh, yes! First.	
FormID: 00013347	SE32	SE32Arrows	0	Bat loves his arrows. They aren't Althel's, they're his. Bat would be betrothed to his arrows if he could. By the way, have you seen my betrothed?	
FormID: 00013546	SE32	SE32Arrows	0	2, 7, 1. You have arrows! 8, 2, 8.  Now let the battle be joined! 1, 8, 2. Why aren't you counting? 8, 4, 5.	The counting should be quick and almost under her breath. It's almost as if she isn't even aware she's doing it.
FormID: 00013544	SE32	SE32Arrows	0	1, 2, 3. That idiot Bat gro-Orkul refused to equip some of us. 5, 8, 13.  He has arrows, but won't give me any of them. 21, 34, 55.	The counting should be quick and almost under her breath. It's almost as if she isn't even aware she's doing it.
FormID: 000135D1	SE32	SE32Arrows	0	Bat gro-Orkul is so stingy with the armory. He should dance today. He may cost us our town today. Then we'll see who dances!	Last sentence is [QUOTE]I'll show you![QUOTE] attitude
FormID: 0008EFD2	SE32	SE32Arrows	0	Athel was a brave scout. She brought us the first word of the Fanatics. My curse will not allow me to help you with her need.	Proud but weary.
FormID: 00043020	SE04	SEFelldew	0	Do keep in mind that some Elytra will not consider you a threat while you are feeling the effects of Felldew Euphoria.	
FormID: 00043020	SE04	SEFelldew	1	You need to strike a balance with how often you ingest Felldew, and how willing you are to live with the side-effects.	
FormID: 000206F7	SE04	SEFelldew	0	Oh, it wouldn't do to speak of it. Thadon's plan for you, I mean. I like you, little one, but I would never interfere with what Thadon wants.	
FormID: 000206F8	SE04	SEFelldew	0	Well, perhaps Thadon would want you to have a bit more guidance. He did say that you should talk to me, did he not?	
FormID: 000206F8	SE04	SEFelldew	1	Felldew is a poison, little one. A very dangerous drug. You'll feel good at first, but that wears off, and if you go long without it, you'll suffer.	
FormID: 00019537	SE04	SEFelldew	0	I've told you, it'll kill you. Actually, now that I think about it, why don't you go eat some? Eat all you can find. I'd get a chuckle out of that.	
FormID: 00019538	SE04	SEFelldew	0	I've told you, it'll kill you. While I don't care if it does, I don't think you want that.	
FormID: 00018B7E	SE04	SEFelldew	0	It's a poison, plain and simple. It'll make you wish you were dead. And given enough time, you will be.	
FormID: 00018B7E	SE04	SEFelldew	1	The Elytra in Dunroot Burrow, the ones that secrete it are immune, but they're the only ones.	
FormID: 00018B7E	SE04	SEFelldew	2	If the Felldew didn't kill you, the Elytra would. You're better off just leaving the thing in the ruins above the Burrow.	
FormID: 0005E372	SE01Door	SE01HaskillChoice10	0	Hmmm. Not surprising. Well, if you change your mind, and the position is still available, come speak with me again.	
FormID: 0005E372	SE01Door	SE01HaskillChoice10	1	I'd so enjoy that....	;he wouldn't enjoy that at all
FormID: 0005E371	SE01Door	SE01HaskillChoice9	0	Fine. I'm sure my Lord will be most pleased, assuming you ever manage to see Him.	
FormID: 0005E371	SE01Door	SE01HaskillChoice9	1	You'll want to pass through the Gates of Madness. Oh, and mind the Gatekeeper. He dislikes strangers to the Realm.	
FormID: 0005E371	SE01Door	SE01HaskillChoice9	2	Enjoy your stay.	
FormID: 000133E7	SE01Door	SE01HaskillChoice8	0	Who is to say? There are always choices to be made. The Realm of Madness is no different in that regard. Your choices are your own.	
FormID: 000133E7	SE01Door	SE01HaskillChoice8	1	Enter or do not, but make your decision. I've other duties to which I must attend.	
FormID: 000133E7	SE01Door	SE01HaskillChoice8	2	Speak with me again when you have made up your mind. The anticipation is almost too much to bear.	;droll, condescending
FormID: 000133E6	SE01Door	SE01HaskillChoice7	0	You do as you will. You may leave the way you entered. Your life will be none the worse for your time spent here.	
FormID: 000133E6	SE01Door	SE01HaskillChoice7	1	Or, you may continue onward, through the door behind me. If you can pass the Gates of Madness, perhaps the Lord Sheogorath will find a use for you.	
FormID: 000133E5	SE01Door	SE01HaskillChoice6	0	Cured? You speak as if they are diseased. They live now in another state of being. Perhaps it is you who needs a cure.	
FormID: 000133E4	SE01Door	SE01HaskillChoice5	0	They entered this Realm, and were ill prepared. Their minds are now the property of my Lord.	
FormID: 000133E3	SE01Door	SE01HaskillChoice4	0	For you? I do not know. My Lord seeks a mortal to act as His Champion. As for His intent... to attempt to fathom it is a foolish endeavor.	
FormID: 000133E3	SE01Door	SE01HaskillChoice4	1	His will is His own; His reality follows suit. You are here because you chose to enter; you were not summoned.	
FormID: 000133E2	SE01Door	SE01HaskillChoice3	0	Because my Lord wills it to be so. It poses no danger to Mundus; no compact has been violated. 	
FormID: 000133E2	SE01Door	SE01HaskillChoice3	1	It is a doorway, an invitation. Perhaps you will accept it for what it is.	
FormID: 000133E1	SE01Door	SE01HaskillChoice2	0	You approach the Shivering Isles. Through the door behind me lies the realm of Sheogorath, Prince of Madness, Lord of the Never-There.	
FormID: 000133E0	SE01Door	SE01HaskillChoice1	0	I am Haskill, Chamberlain to the Lord Sheogorath.	
FormID: 000133DC	SE01Door	SE01GaiusForceGreet	0	I'd stay back from that door if I were you. Nothing that's gone in has come out right.	
FormID: 000133DA	SE01Door	SE01Choice2	0	Ha! It's your funeral. I'm just here to warn people, not keep them out. Go ahead in. I'll be here to clean up the mess when you come out.	
FormID: 000133D9	SE01Door	SE01Choice1	0	Look for yourself! Their brains are addled. Got no sense! Perfectly normal people went in there. And this is what's come out.	
FormID: 000133D8	SE01Door	SEStrangeDoor	0	I don't know where it came from, and I don't want to. Those who've gone in have come back out... wrong. I'm just here to warn folks to stay away.	
FormID: 000133DF	SE01Door	SEStrangeDoor	0	Yes. You have entered and now you are here. Amazing. Truly.	
FormID: 0001357A	SE09	SE09BodyParts	0	Fearing one day someone might manage to kill my child, I have been preparing a new body.	
FormID: 0001357A	SE09	SE09BodyParts	1	I've created versions of each appendage, with various enhancements. You must choose one of each. I am attached to them all. Artist's prerogative.	mild embarassment mostly filled with seperation anxiety
FormID: 0001357B	SE09	SE09BodyParts	0	Select one pair of legs, one left arm, right arm, torso, head, and heart. See me when you have finished your selections.	
FormID: 00081DAB	SE09	SE09ComponentsHow	0	Are you not the exalted Duchess? Slayer of the great Gatekeeper? Champion of our mighty Lord Sheogorath?	bitterly sarcastic and angy
FormID: 00081DAB	SE09	SE09ComponentsHow	1	I'm sure you'll be able to find these things, if not, perhaps Sheogorath's faith in you is misplaced. Go now. You try my patience.	
FormID: 00013573	SE09	SE09ComponentsHow	0	Are you not the exalted Duke? Slayer of the great Gatekeeper? Champion of our mighty Lord Sheogorath?	bitterly sarcastic and angy
FormID: 00013573	SE09	SE09ComponentsHow	1	I'm sure you'll be able to find these things, if not, perhaps Sheogorath's faith in you is misplaced. Go now. You try my patience.	
FormID: 00013571	SE09	SE09Components	0	You will travel to the Gardens of Flesh and Bone and collect for me these things:	
FormID: 00013571	SE09	SE09Components	1	Blood Liqueur, Osseous Marrow, Dermis Membrane, and the Essence of Breath. 	
FormID: 00013572	SE09	SE09Components	0	Bring me Blood Liqueur, Osseous Marrow, Dermis Membrane, and the Essence of Breath.	
FormID: 00013570	SE09	SE09Gardens	0	For many years, I labored painstakingly in those Gardens, until my back bent and my soul became crooked.	
FormID: 00013570	SE09	SE09Gardens	1	But the fruits born of that labor were the essential components of true Flesh.	
FormID: 00013570	SE09	SE09Gardens	2	You will go there and gather the components needed to bring my new child into this world.	
FormID: 0001356F	SE09	SE09AssistanceRequest	0	Yes, powerful magic indeed. It is proper that you bid me kindly, lest I show you the meaning of pain and suffering.	giddy with ego
FormID: 0001356F	SE09	SE09AssistanceRequest	1	Alas, I am still distraught over the destruction of my sweet child. I cannot return to his womb. You must do this.	distant and remorseful
FormID: 0001356F	SE09	SE09AssistanceRequest	2	You will travel to the Gardens of Flesh and Bone. There you will gather mystical components needed for the ceremony.	talking as if an egotistical brilliant teacher to a retarded pupil
FormID: 0001356F	SE09	SE09AssistanceRequest	3	Go fetch me Blood Liqueur, Osseous Marrow, Dermis Membrane, and Essence of Breath.	
FormID: 0001356F	SE09	SE09AssistanceRequest	4	And take this key. It will allow entry into the Gardens and give you direct access to my Sanctum.	
FormID: 0001356E	SE09	SE09AssistanceCommand	0	Fine. If it be my Lord's will, then it is also my own. But, I am too distraught over the death of my child to return to his womb. This, you must do.	resigned and sad
FormID: 0001356E	SE09	SE09AssistanceCommand	1	You will travel to the Gardens of Flesh and Bone. There, you will gather mystical components needed for the ceremony.	regaining her self assurance and composure

FormID: 0001356D	SE09	SE09RebuildRequest	0	Ah, your tone is more in line with my station. Please, continue.	suspsicious but begining to warm to the player
FormID: 0001356C	SE09	SE09RebuildCommand	0	Oh? Does he now?	sickly sweet with mock surprise
FormID: 0001356B	SE09	SE09AuthorityMyOwn	0	Ah. That confirms it. You're the new Duke. The stink of hubris surrounds you! My Lord allows you to lick his boot straps, does he?	bitter and sarcastic
FormID: 0001356B	SE09	SE09AuthorityMyOwn	1	Well, then. I trust my servants didn't give you too hard a time getting here. Haha! Perhaps the Duke would like to explain his business?	sarcastic (she is refering to her guards who the player has had to fight to get past)
FormID: 0001356A	SE09	SE09AuthoritySheogoraths	0	I see. Sheogorath is too important to come on his own account? He sends his mortal lackey?	sickly sweet, sarcastic and deeming
FormID: 0001356A	SE09	SE09AuthoritySheogoraths	1	Well, then. I trust my servants didn't give you too hard a time getting in here. Haha! What is it Sheogorath's lackey requires of me?	very sarcastic (she is refering to her guards who the player has had to fight to get past)
FormID: 00013568	SE09	SE09SlainUmm	0	Now you make excuses? Pathetic. On what authority have you weaseled into my sanctum and disturbed my work, hmm?	condescending and annoyed
FormID: 00013567	SE09	SE09SlainNo	0	Am I, really? I think not. Be that as it may, on what authority do you disturb my work?	(after player accuses her of being mistaken): incredulous, then suspicious and annoyed
FormID: 00013569	SE09	SE09SlainYes	0	The ends justify the means, do they? You'll pay for that, one day. Now, by all means, come right in, walk in here as if you own the place....	very angry and bitterly sarcastic
FormID: 00013569	SE09	SE09SlainYes	1	By what authority do you disturb me?!	violent, explosive anger
FormID: 0007FE1E	SE05	SE04Audience	0	I can tell you that while she stays out of the public eye these days, she does still hold audience in her court during the day.	
FormID: 0007FE1E	SE05	SE04Audience	1	You may attempt to approach her then. The Lady has been concerned about her safety lately, so be prepared for a hostile reaction.	
FormID: 0001359B	SE05	SE04Audience	0	You wish to see Lady Syl, do you?	
FormID: 0001359B	SE05	SE04Audience	1	The Lady has refused any and all appointments of late. You'd have to try and find her on your own, and I don't recommend that course of action.	
FormID: 000135D2	SE32	SE32NotSolved	0	The defenders of the gate were not the only ones to fail their town. My greatest shame is that I was struck by cowardice and fled.	
FormID: 000135D2	SE32	SE32NotSolved	1	Like my people, I am doomed to repeat the actions of my cowardice. Alone, I cannot redress this wrong. However, you can.	
FormID: 000135D2	SE32	SE32NotSolved	2	Take my helm. With it, you can take my place in the defense of the gate. Defeat the Devoted Fanatic in combat, and the curse will be lifted.	
FormID: 000135D2	SE32	SE32NotSolved	3	Be warned though. While you wear the helm, it is as if you are one of us. You are trapped in these ruins until you lift our curse.	
FormID: 0001361E	SE05	SE05SylHelpNo	0	No? Have you seen my torture chamber?  Because that's where you'll wind up if you don't agree to assist me. Think on it.	threatening, paranoid
FormID: 0001361F	SE05	SE05SylHelp	0	You're going to find out who knows. You're going to learn who keeps secrets, who conspires against me.	talking fast, getting agitated
FormID: 0001361F	SE05	SE05SylHelp	1	You will be my Grand Inquisitor. Expose the conspirators, and they will be punished, I assure you. Find out who keeps secrets, and what they are.	animated, emphasis on naming [QUOTE]Grand Inquisitor[QUOTE] as very magnanimous
FormID: 0001361F	SE05	SE05SylHelp	2	Speak with Herdir. He will help you. Do you understand what is required of you? If no one is found, you will be held responsible.	suspicious, paranoid
FormID: 0008F7D9	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	You're the only one who understands me, and you'd think me a traitor? You disappoint me, friend. I'll take my leave now.	
FormID: 0007D465	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	Naryan that! I'll balitoe before I krayble.	
FormID: 0008ADEC	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	You know what I know. There is no more.	with a slow sensual drawl
FormID: 00089617	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	I don't spread gossip. I have nothing to say.	with a slow sensual drawl
FormID: 00089619	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	Leave me be! I've told you what I know!	
FormID: 0008ADED	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	Nothin' in it for me, so I've nothin' to say to you.	
FormID: 0008961A	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	I've told you what I know. There's nothing more!	
FormID: 0008960F	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	What more is there to say, Inquisitor? Lady Syl has her moment of glory. Allow her to bask in it.	
FormID: 00089610	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	Lady Syl will be quite pleased to hear that her concerns have been proven valid. You shouldn't keep her waiting.	
FormID: 000895DD	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	Nelrene admits to being involved, but more evidence may be required.	
FormID: 000895DD	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	1	Ma'zaddha may have returned with more information by now.	
FormID: 00089604	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	The Inquisitor now has significant evidence pointing towards Muurine. Perhaps a talk with her is in order.	
FormID: 00089605	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	It would seem that your only course of action now is to extract information from Nelrene, Inquisitor.	
FormID: 00089606	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	Convincing a Dark Seducer to reveal secrets to you may require more pressure than you've experienced thus far.	
FormID: 000895DE	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	Congratulations. You've gained another ally in your efforts. Do remember to follow up with Ma'zaddha.	
FormID: 000895DE	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	1	In the meantime, the other party in that conversation may be of use to you as well.	
FormID: 000895DF	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	Surely the Inquisitor has considered that with direct evidence, Ma'zaddha may now be more responsive to questioning.	
FormID: 000895E0	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	The Inquisitor is now required to be secretive? Consider that Herdir's presence may be a detriment to you.	
FormID: 000895E0	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	1	He is not known for his ability to remain hidden.	
FormID: 000895E1	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	It would seem that direct torture may not always yield the results you seek. You may need to try a different approach, Inquisitor.	
FormID: 000895E1	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	1	Paranoia is the order of the day in Crucible. Many keep their eyes open constantly, and some of those eyes may have seen something useful.	
FormID: 000895E2	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	Ma'zaddha is particularly reclusive, and may not respond well to questioning. Again, you may find Herdir's assistance necessary.	
FormID: 000895E3	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	Torture may be a necessary evil to accomplish Syl's goals. Make sure Herdir accompanies you to talk to Anya. 	
FormID: 000895E4	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	Keep in mind that Anya is cowardly, and may require persuasion to tell you what she knows. 	
FormID: 000895E5	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	You may find the enormity of your task daunting at first. Use Herdir's talents to aid you with those who are unresponsive to questioning.	
FormID: 000895E6	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	You have been asked to work with Herdir, I understand. 	
FormID: 000895E6	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	1	Herdir has a great affinity for his work, and can be a very useful ally to you. Do not hesitate to make use of his talents.	
FormID: 000895E7	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	Find those who plot against me. Bring them to me so I might make an example of them.	quietly fuming
FormID: 0008961B	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	I've nothing to tell the likes of you!	
FormID: 00089530	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	You already know my part in this. There is nothing more to say.	
FormID: 0008568C	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	You've got what you need from me. I can't tell you anything more.	
FormID: 000819A1	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	No, no. I know nothing.	
FormID: 00089531	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	Haven't you got what you need? Shouldn't you be running off to tattle like a good little servant?	
FormID: 00081368	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	I see you've done quite a bit of work to track me down.	
FormID: 00081368	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	1	Yes, I orchestrated it. Syl deserves to die a painful death for turning on all of us, and consorting with our enemies.	
FormID: 00081368	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	2	Go ahead, do what you will. Nothing matters now.	
FormID: 000811C8	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	You have no proof! You cannot hold me accountable for anything!	
FormID: 0008199D	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	You have no proof! You cannot hold me accountable for anything!	
FormID: 000811CB	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	I hope for your sake you are not accusing me of anything.	
FormID: 00089532	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	I've agreed to help you already. Torturing me further will do you no good!	
FormID: 00080D7C	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	I've told you, I don't know anything. You can't prove a thing!	
FormID: 0008117A	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	I've told you, I don't know anything. You can't prove a thing!	
FormID: 0008117E	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about.	
FormID: 00080D7F	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	I've told you all I know. It was Ma'zaddha... I don't know anything more, I swear it!	
FormID: 00080D3D	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	What? N...No. I don't know anything about anything. I'm sorry, I can't help you.	Nervous, hiding something
FormID: 00080D3E	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	I've told you everything I know! I swear!	
FormID: 00080D40	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	I don't know anything about a conspiracy, but Anya has been looking extra nervous lately.	
FormID: 00080D40	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	1	She might know something more than I do.	
FormID: 00080D41	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	No conspiracies here. Go pester someone else.	
FormID: 000806EA	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	I don't expect we'll learn much. While I have the utmost respect for her Ladyship, she is well known for being... overly cautious.	
FormID: 000806EA	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	1	We must carry out her wishes, however. And I, for one, am looking forward to, ahh... interacting with the citizens of Crucible.	
FormID: 0007FF42	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	I don't know anything about a conspiracy.	
FormID: 0001AC5A	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	Yes? What would you have me say about it?	
FormID: 0001A2E0	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	Oh, no. You'll not drag me into Syl's mess. She made this bed, now it's up to her to burn it.	
FormID: 0007FDF2	SE05	SE05Conspiracy	0	I don't know anything about a conspiracy!	
FormID: 000139AF	SE07	SE07RitualYesM	0	Arden-Sul was perhaps the greatest Duke to walk our land.	
FormID: 000139AF	SE07	SE07RitualYesM	1	Many years ago he decided to hold a night of absolute indulgence, resplendent with dance, wine, and sex to celebrate his fondness for his brethren.	
FormID: 000139AF	SE07	SE07RitualYesM	2	The Greenmote flowed like water in a stream as the revelers voraciously succumbed to its rapturous ways.	
FormID: 00013661	SE07	SE07RitualNoM	0	Certainly. When the ruler of Mania has decided it is time, he will choose a successor from his court.	
FormID: 00013661	SE07	SE07RitualNoM	1	The successor is invited to a huge celebration... a night of hedonistic revelry; wine, song, and, of course, Greenmote.	
FormID: 00013661	SE07	SE07RitualNoM	2	During this, the exiting regent imbibes three doses of the potent drug. This causes his heart to burst... and his lifeblood flows from his body.	
FormID: 00013661	SE07	SE07RitualNoM	3	The successor then gathers the drug-tainted blood and brings it to the Altar of Arden-Sul in the Sacellum.	
FormID: 00013661	SE07	SE07RitualNoM	4	Once this is done, I will proclaim the successor a Duke or Duchess. Then, Sheogorath gives His blessing, and the cycle is completed.	
FormID: 00013665	SE07	SE07Ritual	0	As I've told you friend, the Duke's drug-tainted blood must be brought to the Altar of Arden-Sul.	
FormID: 00013655	SE07	SE07Ritual	0	An important part of our history, my friend! I would be glad to tell the tale if you have a moment.	
FormID: 00013658	SE07	SE07Ritual	0	Didn't we go over this already? Bring the Duke's heart to the Altar of Arden-Sul. It's quite simple.	
FormID: 00013660	SE07	SE07Ritual	0	Seldom is the subject ever bro-... wait a moment, did you want to hear the history of the Ritual?	Pause after [QUOTE]bro-[QUOTE] as if a thought just occurred to you. Bro is the word [QUOTE]broached[QUOTE] cut off.
FormID: 0007893F	SE07	SE07Ritual	0	Obviously, no matter which path you take, it ends in the death of either Syl or Thadon.	
FormID: 0007893F	SE07	SE07Ritual	1	Just remember not to deviate from the Ritual's guidelines. One would hope you can do that.	
FormID: 0001365F	SE07	SE07RitualNoD	0	Very well. Spoken like a true son of the Demented.	
FormID: 0001365F	SE07	SE07RitualNoD	1	To become ruler of Dementia, the current leader's heart must be cut out and brought to the Altar of Arden-Sul in the Sacellum.	
FormID: 0001365F	SE07	SE07RitualNoD	2	Once this is done, I can pronounce the heart-bearer a Duke or Duchess. Then, all that is required is the blessing of our lord, Sheogorath.	
FormID: 00013657	SE07	SE07Become	0	Yes... how we would all aspire to be as great a leader as the First... our savior Arden-Sul, the greatest Duke of the ages.	
FormID: 00013657	SE07	SE07Become	1	We celebrate him with the Ritual of Accession... the path to Maniac Bliss.	
FormID: 0001365E	SE07	SE07Become	0	Interesting. Not many wish to hear about such things, but I would be glad to oblige.	
FormID: 0001365E	SE07	SE07Become	1	Becoming the Duke of Dementia requires passage through the Ritual of Accession, specific guidelines set forth by Arden-Sul himself.	
FormID: 0007893E	SE07	SE07Become	0	I offer you this: remember who it is you're attempting to replace. You'll need to approach them in a manner to which they are not accustomed.	
FormID: 0007893E	SE07	SE07Become	1	Syl anticipates plots against her, so expect heavy resistance that may require a great deal of fighting and physical exertion.	
FormID: 0007893E	SE07	SE07Become	2	If you wish to replace Thadon, try a less direct approach that will involve cunning and subterfuge. He isn't likely to see you coming.	
FormID: 0001365D	SE07	SE07RitualYesD	0	As it happened so many years ago, my lord Arden-Sul suspected a traitor in his midst.	
FormID: 0001365D	SE07	SE07RitualYesD	1	Not wishing to find himself on the wrong end of a blade, he gathered his flock here in the Sacellum.	
FormID: 0001365D	SE07	SE07RitualYesD	2	By poisoning the sacramental wine, Arden-Sul was able to suppress any such conspiracy in one fell swoop.	
FormID: 0001365C	SE07	SE07Displeased	0	No. No, no, no. Absolutely not.	
FormID: 0001365C	SE07	SE07Displeased	1	Well... yes. Absolutely. Bit of a shame for them.	
FormID: 0001365C	SE07	SE07Displeased	2	But, sometimes you need to break a few eggs. Or skulls. There are rules, though. Even in the Isles. Rituals and rules. You need to follow them.	
FormID: 0001365C	SE07	SE07Displeased	3	Speak to Arctus and Dervenin, the High Priests at the Sacellum Arden-Sul. They can explain what needs to be done.	
FormID: 0001365C	SE07	SE07Displeased	4	And you've always got our man Haskill to call on for help. Faithful like a good hound, that one. And he looks better in a suit.	
FormID: 000139AE	SE07	SE07GreenmoteTopic	0	How does one describe utter euphoria?	
FormID: 000139AE	SE07	SE07GreenmoteTopic	1	It is the substance that shapes our imagination and makes every day a joyful, waking dream.	
FormID: 000139AE	SE07	SE07GreenmoteTopic	2	Harvested from the spore trees that dot Bliss, the Greenmote is refined and kept in storage for use by all.	
FormID: 000139AD	SE07	SE07ChDementia	0	A dangerous choice. I like it! She's gotten to be a bit much, anyway. Thinks everyone is out to get her. Which they are, in this case. So be it.	
FormID: 000139AC	SE07	SE07ChMania	0	A safer choice, perhaps. Maybe you'll live through this. Thadon's a bit lost these days. Not that it's a bad thing. It suits him. Until now.	
FormID: 000139AC	SE07	SE07ChMania	1	Besides, won't it be a grand surprise when you make his heart burst from too much Greenmote? Thadon loves surprises!	
FormID: 000139B2	SE05	SE05SylKill	0	That's exactly what they'd be expecting. They'll have replacements lined up, and then there could be even more of them surrounding me.	paranoid, conspiratorial
FormID: 000139B2	SE05	SE05SylKill	1	No, no. Too easy a fate for them. That's why you're going to help me. You're going to find them, force their hands. Put them to the screws.	angry, excited almost to the point of hysteria
FormID: 000139B3	SE05	SE05SylWho	0	Could be all of them. Every last one. None can be trusted.	hushed tones, paranoid
FormID: 000139B3	SE05	SE05SylWho	1	But they'll never take me down. Never! I'll see them all rotting in shallow graves before I let my guard down!	shouting, defying any who might hear her
FormID: 000139B3	SE05	SE05SylWho	2	You... you will help me. Yes, yes. You will be most useful.	plotting, conspiratorial
FormID: 00013A56	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate1	0	Hrmph. Very well, Steward. I believe you. You may return to your duties. And of course, thank you for your time.	
FormID: 00013FEC	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate1	0	She doesn't tell me where she goes. It's not my place to know. Please, there's nothing else. There's nothing else to tell you.	
FormID: 00013FED	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate1	0	What do you mean, she goes somewhere? Where does she go?	
FormID: 00013FEE	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate1	0	Wait! Wait, no. Please. All I know is that on certain nights, Syl asked me to guard her chambers. She never said why. I think she went somewhere.	
FormID: 00013FEF	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate1	0	Very well, then. You leave me no choice...	
FormID: 00013FF0	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate1	0	I told you. I'm not hiding anything.	
FormID: 00013FF1	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate1	0	Yes, yes. I'm sure I will. But for now, we still have the matter of the information you're withholding. Will you share it with us?	
FormID: 00013FF2	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate1	0	You'll.... You'll pay for this, Herdir. Make no mistake...	
FormID: 00013FF3	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate1	0	Does that pain you, Kithlan? Unless you want to feel it again, you'd best tell us what you know.	
FormID: 00013FE9	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate1	0	I'm sorry, Kithlan, but I don't believe you. I think you're lying. And you know what happens to people who lie to me.	
FormID: 00013A57	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate1	0	What are you talking about? I don't know anything! There's nothing going on!	
FormID: 00013A58	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate1	0	Is that so? Well, then perhaps you know something that may be useful to our Inquisitor. Would you care to share that information?	
FormID: 00013A5A	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate1	0	But I AM innocent. I've done nothing!	
FormID: 00013A5B	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate1	0	Lady Syl, you mean. And you know I have her full authority to do what is necessary. Your innocence must be proven.	
FormID: 00013A5C	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate1	0	Herdir, you filth. You don't dare touch me. Syl will have your head!	
FormID: 00013A5F	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate1	0	Hello, Steward. Welcome to my little corner of the castle.	
FormID: 00013A6D	SE07A	SE07AAnya	0	Shhh. The walls have ears!	
FormID: 00013A6D	SE07A	SE07AAnya	1	I hear that in light of recent events at the palace, Anya Herrick is more loyal to Syl than ever. In fact, she rarely leaves her side!	
FormID: 00013A6E	SE07A	SE07AAnya	0	Do you take me for a fool? How do I know you aren't acting as an agent of Dementia?	
FormID: 00013A6B	SE07A	SE07AKithlan	0	Well, I've heard that recent events in Syl's court have made Kithlan a bit disillusioned with its leadership. But you didn't hear that from me.	
FormID: 00013A6C	SE07A	SE07AKithlan	0	Yeah, sure. Like I'm going to say something about Syl's court to the likes of you!	
FormID: 000167DE	SE07B	SE07BThadon	0	Yes, I must attend to him. Speaking to you has already cost me time. I must go.	
FormID: 000167E0	SE07B	SE07BThadon	0	Such a kind and noble man. In times like these, it's good to have a leader who still enjoys all the modern pleasures Mania has to offer.	
FormID: 00016EA8	SE07B	SE07BThadon	0	Ah yes, and what of our Duke of Mania?	
FormID: 0006A896	SE07B	SE07BThadon	0	Thadon may be in a constant state of euphoria, but I wouldn't underestimate his intelligence. Oh, this is so much fun!	Say the last part with glee.
FormID: 00016570	SE07B	SE07BThadon	0	If I were you, I'd check with Thadon's Steward, Wide-Eye.	
FormID: 00016570	SE07B	SE07BThadon	1	You can usually find her roaming around New Sheoth, or spending a lot of time on the palace grounds.	
FormID: 00013FFD	SE07A	SE07ASyl	0	She is staying well out of sight. No need to take unnecessary risks.	
FormID: 00013FFD	SE07A	SE07ASyl	1	I maintain a close watch on her. She fears that Sheogorath no longer favors her presence and wants her replaced.	
FormID: 00013A6F	SE07A	SE07ASyl	0	I suppose I should be grateful working in the palace with her, but I can't stand having to constantly look over my shoulder.	
FormID: 00013A6F	SE07A	SE07ASyl	1	I don't know if she has it in for me or not. I think she is in constant fear of being replaced.	
FormID: 00013A68	SE07A	SE07ASyl	0	All I can tell you is Syl is rarely seen in public, and her staff takes care of the day-to-day activities.	
FormID: 00013A68	SE07A	SE07ASyl	1	I'd check with Anya Herrick, her Courtier, and Kithlan, her Steward. Maybe they can help you.	
FormID: 0006A890	SE07A	SE07ASyl	0	Syl is as crafty as she is beautiful. I'd watch my back if I were you. Oh, this is so much fun!	Say last part with glee.
FormID: 00013A66	SE07	SE07RitualYesD02	0	Yes. He then removed their hearts from their bodies and used his ancient scrying technique known as visceromancy to read their lifeblood.	
FormID: 00013A66	SE07	SE07RitualYesD02	1	When Arden-Sul couldn't divine the traitor's true nature in their hearts, he became distraught and took his own life in the same way.	
FormID: 00013A66	SE07	SE07RitualYesD02	2	From that day on, the Ritual of Accession for the throne of Dementia was set.	
FormID: 00013A67	SE07	SE07RitualYesM02	0	Ahhh, but it was. As the bacchanal reached a crescendo, the people began to clutch their chests as their very hearts exploded!	
FormID: 00013A67	SE07	SE07RitualYesM02	1	The Greenmote had taken its toll. The ground stained a deep crimson as the sanguine liquid flowed from their lifeless bodies.	
FormID: 00013A67	SE07	SE07RitualYesM02	2	To represent that night, when the ruler of Mania is to be replaced, he partakes of the Greenmote and allows his lifeblood to flow upon the Altar.	
FormID: 00014450	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate2	0	As you wish, Miss Herrick. Thank you for your time. And please, come back and see me some time.	
FormID: 0001447B	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate2	0	Yes, yes! I swear it's the truth! Please, please let me go!	
FormID: 0001447C	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate2	0	Is that so?	
FormID: 0001447D	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate2	0	It was Muurine. She said she found a note from Thadon, that she would tell people it was written to me unless I paid her. It's not mine, I tell you!	
FormID: 0001447E	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate2	0	Threatened? Who threatened you, my dear?	
FormID: 0001447F	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate2	0	I... I didn't do anything. She threatened me, but I didn't do anything. I'm loyal to Syl, I tell you!	
FormID: 00014480	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate2	0	Yes, well. I suspect our Inquisitor would like to see you leave as well. As soon as you tell me what I want to know, you may go.	
FormID: 00014481	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate2	0	I... I don't want to stay here! Please stop hurting me!	
FormID: 00014482	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate2	0	Now Miss Herrick, can we be frank with one another? I find you delightful. I'd so enjoy the pleasure of your company for a long time to come.	
FormID: 00014486	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate2	0	I think there's more to it than that. And I see that I'm going to have to persuade you to be honest with me. How delightful.	
FormID: 00014451	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate2	0	What? No! I'm loyal to Lady Syl, I swear it! I would never turn against her! I just heard a rumor, that's all! I don't know anything!	
FormID: 00014452	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate2	0	Come now. We all know you've spread rumors about Thadon leaving his section of the palace late at night. You've been meeting him, haven't you?	
FormID: 00014453	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate2	0	No, no! I haven't been plotting anything! I swear it!	
FormID: 00014454	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate2	0	Oh, I think we both know the answer to that. You're here because you know something. You're plotting behind Lady Syl's back, and you've been caught.	
FormID: 00014455	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate2	0	What? I... No, that's not it at all. I just... I don't know. Why am I here?	
FormID: 00014459	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate2	0	Welcome, Miss Herrick! Welcome! I'd been hoping to have a chance to chat with you. I get the sense that you avoid me.	
FormID: 00015636	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate3	0	Now you will release me at once!	
FormID: 00015858	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate3	0	Why would I be so stupid as to carry it around? It's safe in my home. Yes, that's right. Are you going to go and get it yourself? I think not.	
FormID: 00015859	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate3	0	Where is this note? Produce it immediately!	
FormID: 0001585A	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate3	0	The note from Thadon, talking about some secret rendezvous with someone from Syl's court. I'm sure it's important to someone.	
FormID: 0001585B	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate3	0	I... What note are you talking about? I don't understand.	
FormID: 0001585C	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate3	0	Ha ha! Weren't expecting this, were you? You'll get no more enjoyment from me today, Herdir. All I know about is the note.	
FormID: 0001585D	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate3	0	What? Is this some kind of a trick?	
FormID: 0001585E	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate3	0	The pleasure you get from this hasn't escaped me, Herdir. So this time, I'm going to deny you that pleasure. I'll tell you what you want to know.	
FormID: 0001585F	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate3	0	I get by. But let's not change the subject. We're here to talk about you. About what you know.	
FormID: 00015860	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate3	0	I see you've made it even more painful. You do enjoy your work, don't you Herdir?	
FormID: 00015861	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate3	0	Shall we try again?	
FormID: 00015862	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate3	0	Oh, my. Well, if you insist.	
FormID: 00015637	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate3	0	Hurt me all you want, Herdir. You know I won't talk.	
FormID: 00015638	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate3	0	Welcome back, Muurine. It's been an unusually long while since I've seen you here.	
FormID: 00015627	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate4	0	I had hoped we'd spend more time together, but yes, I realize you're being honest. Thank you for your time, Nelrene.	
FormID: 00015628	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate4	0	You know truth when you hear it, Herdir. I have spoken truth. You cannot intimidate me, so I suggest you release me at once.	
FormID: 00015629	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate4	0	Is there anything else you'd care to reveal, as long as you're here?	
FormID: 0001562A	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate4	0	I cannot say, as I do not know. Only Kithlan has access to certain areas of the palace aside from Lady Syl. Perhaps it was him.	
FormID: 0001562B	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate4	0	Really? And whom might this figure be?	
FormID: 0001562C	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate4	0	I am being honest, that is all. The only strange reports I have received are of a robed figure seen leaving the palace late at night.	
FormID: 0001562D	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate4	0	Is that so? But isn't that exactly the sort of thing you'd say if you were behind it all? You're in a position to deny it.	
FormID: 0001562E	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate4	0	I have no reports of any such conspiracy at the present time, despite my Lady's repeated insistence that one exists. There is no danger.	
FormID: 0001562F	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate4	0	Oh, Nelrene. You take the fun out of everything. Very well. What do you know of a conspiracy against Lady Syl?	
FormID: 00015630	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate4	0	Perhaps not, but we both know it's something you've fantasized over. I'm surprised you can contain your excitement to speak. Get on with it.	
FormID: 00015631	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate4	0	Come now, must we start with hostilities? This situation is not of my creation.	
FormID: 00015632	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate4	0	Spare me your pleasantries, Herdir. Ask what you will and be done.	
FormID: 00015633	SE05Conversations	SE05Interrogate4	0	I must say, this is quite a surprise! I certainly didn't expect to see you down here, Nelrene.	
FormID: 00014026	SE07A	SE07AAnyaHelp	0	Well, the best I can offer is help with the guards. I can distract at least two of them and get them to leave her wing of the palace.	
FormID: 00014026	SE07A	SE07AAnyaHelp	1	That should help you to get in there a bit easier.	
FormID: 00014025	SE07A	SE07AKithlanHelp	0	Hmmm. That may be difficult. Syl has been hidden from public sight lately. However, I can give you something that may help.	
FormID: 00014025	SE07A	SE07AKithlanHelp	1	Take this key. It should unlock any door in her wing of the palace. You still need to be wary of her Seducer guards, but it should help.	
FormID: 00013FFB	SE07A	SE07AReplace	0	Perhaps I've misjudged you. Alright. I'll help. Just remember me when you take over her position.	
FormID: 00013FFB	SE07A	SE07AReplace	1	What can I do to help you?	
FormID: 00013FFC	SE07A	SE07AReplace	0	Ha! You're mad! Syl has yet to be bested in any combat!	
FormID: 00013FFC	SE07A	SE07AReplace	1	Unless... well, if you think you have a chance. How do I know this isn't some sort of trick?	
FormID: 00013FFF	SE07A	SE07AReplace	0	Yes, I see you may have what it takes to replace her.	
FormID: 00013FFF	SE07A	SE07AReplace	1	Very well, what is it you need from me?	
FormID: 00014000	SE07A	SE07AReplace	0	No! I cannot even think such thoughts. How do I know I can trust you won't become just as tyrannical as she has?	
FormID: 00014707	TG08Blind	TG08NoStone	0	I had hoped you would have it with you. Go get the stone and return at once.	
FormID: 00014705	TG08Blind	TG08GiveStone	0	Capital! Now I can see past the palace defenses. It's a good thing the Emperor didn't know they had this stone.	
FormID: 00014705	TG08Blind	TG08GiveStone	1	He would have had it destroyed or taken it from them and kept it under lock and key in the palace.	
FormID: 00014705	TG08Blind	TG08GiveStone	2	Now for the bad news. You committed murder to retrieve the stone. I am forced to remove you from the Thieves Guild until you pay the blood price.	
FormID: 00014705	TG08Blind	TG08GiveStone	3	You may pay me now, or Armand Christophe later should you choose to return to my good graces.	
FormID: 0001CF35	TG08Blind	TG08GiveStone	0	Capital! Now I can see past the palace defenses. It's a good thing the Emperor didn't know they had this stone.	REC   He says capital twice. You might be able to remove it digitally.
FormID: 0001CF35	TG08Blind	TG08GiveStone	1	He would have had it destroyed or taken it from them and kept it under lock and key in the palace.	
FormID: 0001CF35	TG08Blind	TG08GiveStone	2	When I have learned what I need to know, I will call for you again. Let us leave Helvius' house now. He has served me well and deserves his peace.	
FormID: 00014704	TG08Blind	TG08SavillasStoneTopic	0	My sources tell me that Savilla's Stone has gone missing. Do you have it with you?	
FormID: 0009838B	TG08Blind	TG08SavillasStoneTopic	0	I have no idea what you are talking about.	
FormID: 0009838C	TG08Blind	TG08SavillasStoneTopic	0	I've never heard of it. Why do you ask?	
FormID: 0009838D	TG08Blind	TG08SavillasStoneTopic	0	I really shouldn't be telling you this, but I know you are trustworthy.	
FormID: 0009838D	TG08Blind	TG08SavillasStoneTopic	1	The blind monks in the catacombs guard the stone. It's said to have magical powers.	Do NOT rerecord. I changed the text to match the audio.
FormID: 0009838D	TG08Blind	TG08SavillasStoneTopic	2	Don't tell Hridi I said anything. I could be banished for telling you.	
FormID: 0009838E	TG08Blind	TG08SavillasStoneTopic	0	Who is this Savilla? A former lover perhaps? I don't know anyone by that name.	
FormID: 00014700	TG08Blind	TG08MethredhelDeliverMsg	0	The Gray Fox has a task for you. Meet him at Helvius Cecia's house in Bruma.	
FormID: 000146FF	TG08Blind	TG08accept	0	Capital! The monastery is called the Temple of the Ancestor Moths. It is where retired, blind Moth priests go to wait out the rest of their days.	
FormID: 000146FF	TG08Blind	TG08accept	1	I will mark the location on your map. Look for it in the far northeast of Cyrodiil, beyond Cheydinhal.	
FormID: 000146FF	TG08Blind	TG08accept	2	I need you to acquire Savilla's Stone. It is a large crystal with special properties that I need to gain... advantage.	
FormID: 000146FF	TG08Blind	TG08accept	3	Remember, do not shed innocent blood. However, there is no bloodprice for slaying the stone's guardians, human or inhuman.	
FormID: 000146FF	TG08Blind	TG08accept	4	When I receive word that Savilla's Stone is missing, I will be here waiting for you.	
FormID: 000146FE	TG08Blind	TG08reject	0	Preparation is the key to success. Come back to me when you are better prepared.	
FormID: 0001473A	TG06Atonement	TG06NoRescue	0	You bastard! It's not like I killed her. I just roughed her up a bit. Nothin' the healers can't fix.	
FormID: 00014739	TG06Atonement	TG06Rescue	0	Just unlock the door. A couple of hours after you're gone, it will be quiet again and I can sneak out.	
FormID: 0001474B	TG08Blind	TG08LuckyGuess	0	You should know better than to give heed to rumors.	
FormID: 0001474A	TG08Blind	TG08MothPriestNote	0	I see. I suppose there is no hiding it from you. No hiding. What a joke! My whole life is hiding.	
FormID: 0001474A	TG08Blind	TG08MothPriestNote	1	Everything in that document is true. My identity cannot be known. In fact I just told you my true name twice, but I bet you don't remember it.	
FormID: 0001474A	TG08Blind	TG08MothPriestNote	2	You and I have even met before, when I was not wearing the cowl. To your clouded memory he and I are two different people.	
FormID: 0001474A	TG08Blind	TG08MothPriestNote	3	My own family doesn't even know me. I would give much to be rid of the Gray Cowl and its curse.	
FormID: 00014749	TG08Blind	TG08GrayCowl	0	You think this is Nocturnal's cowl? Where did you hear about that?	
FormID: 00014829	TG09Arrow	TG09NoArrow	0	Well go get it!	
FormID: 0001CF36	TG09Arrow	TG09GiveArrowHead	0	Hmmm. I had hoped for the whole arrow, but that is not your fault. I will have to have it repaired.	
FormID: 0001CF36	TG09Arrow	TG09GiveArrowHead	1	This arrowhead advances my plan... nevermind.	
FormID: 0001CF36	TG09Arrow	TG09GiveArrowHead	2	Where was I? Oh, yes. You have embarrassed the Thieves Guild and me with your crude murders to recover the arrowhead.	
FormID: 0001CF36	TG09Arrow	TG09GiveArrowHead	3	Until you pay the blood price, your membership in the guild is forfeit. You can pay me now, or Armand later if you wish to rejoin.	
FormID: 0001482A	TG09Arrow	TG09GiveArrowHead	0	Hmmm. I had hoped for the whole arrow, but that is not your fault. I will have to have it repaired.	
FormID: 0001482A	TG09Arrow	TG09GiveArrowHead	1	This arrowhead advances my plan to... nevermind. I may have need of you again in the near future, if my plans hold.	
FormID: 0001482A	TG09Arrow	TG09GiveArrowHead	2	Here is your reward. I am also promoting you to Master Thief in the Thieves Guild. Fathis Ules of the Imperial City will be your new fence.	REC

FormID: 00014827	TG09Arrow	TG09reject	0	Then make your preparations. I will expect you to return soon.	
FormID: 00014826	TG09Arrow	TG09accept	0	Capital! Bring me the Arrow of Extrication. It has a key shaped head. Bravil's court wizard, Fathis Aren, recently acquired this unique item.	
FormID: 00014826	TG09Arrow	TG09accept	1	You may kill Fathis if necessary, but not in the castle. My spy network will tell me when you have it. Return here with the arrow when you do.

FormID: 0008F12B	SE11	SE11Tree	0	There are those who prescribe a mystical quality to the Grove of Reflection in Milchar. If you ask me, the matter is purely practical.	
FormID: 0008F12B	SE11	SE11Tree	1	There is a great deal of runoff from the waters of Mania that collects in Milchar. One particular tree has grown healthy from those waters.	
FormID: 0008F12B	SE11	SE11Tree	2	The Grove and the Tree retain a number of psychotropic properties that supposedly bring one to personal revelation.	
FormID: 0008F12B	SE11	SE11Tree	3	The truth of this, well, it is open to interpretation. Being the pragmatic fellow that I am, I side on the practical explanation.	
FormID: 0008F12B	SE11	SE11Tree	4	One thing that is not in dispute is that the Tree has survived for eons and its branches are highly valued as components of magical artifacts.

FormID: 00016EF5	SE11	SE11StaffOfSheogorath	1	But, apotheosis is no simple matter and the creation of the staff is no simple task. I will require two sacred items in order to complete it.

FormID: 00016EFC	SE11	SE11KnifePointHollow	2	Time and place are nothing. Constructs of a feeble mortal mind attempting to categorize and understand the world around it.

FormID: 00014B61	SE11	SE11HaskillChoice6	0	That which is lost can be found again. There is one being in the Shivering Isles who may be able to assist you in the construction of a new Staff.	
FormID: 00014B61	SE11	SE11HaskillChoice6	1	The ruins of Knifepoint Hollow once served as a great library. There, you will find a door. Behind that door, you will find the answer you seek.	
FormID: 00014B61	SE11	SE11HaskillChoice6	2	Although... I hesitate to guide you towards this path. The secrets of the past will surely aid Jyggalag, but I fear that we have no other choice.	
FormID: 00014B61	SE11	SE11HaskillChoice6	3	Be mindful of what you find there. The library is a thing of Order, and it will still serve that end.	
FormID: 00014B61	SE11	SE11HaskillChoice6	4	Take this crystal. It contains the power to open the sealed door. Inside, you will find the final remnants of the library.	
FormID: 00014B62	SE11	SE11HaskillChoice5	0	Unfortunately, when Sheogorath faded, the power of the Staff faded with him. It must now be remade.

FormID: 00014B63	SE11	SE11HaskillChoice4	0	True, but perhaps you can hold the throne -- provided that you possess the proper symbol of office. Namely: the Staff of Sheogorath.	
FormID: 00014B64	SE11	SE11HaskillChoice3	0	Why, you will, of course. It has always been Sheogorath's intent for you to be the new Madgod.	
FormID: 00014B65	SE11	SE11HaskillChoice2	0	You will sit on the throne. It has always been Sheogorath's intent for you to be the new Madgod.	
FormID: 00014B66	SE11	SE11HaskillChoice1	0	My duty now is to the Realm. By serving you, I serve Lord Sheogorath.	Slightly insulted.

FormID: 00019CCF	SE11	SE11DyusChoice1	1	The Staff is a tool of great vision and thus, requires the eye of one who has witnessed one of these unseen secrets firsthand.

FormID: 0001D040	MS29	ThoronirTopic	2	Be ever vigilant. The crime of grave robbing is punishable only by death, so Agarmir is likely to do anything to keep his crimes secret.

FormID: 000167E3	SE07B	SE07BGreenmote	2	Only a select few, such as myself, know the Silo's location. However, we are sworn to secrecy.	
FormID: 000167E4	SE07B	SE07BGreenmote	0	I've heard of such a grand place. Ahhh... to imagine all that wonderful Greenmote under one roof.

FormID: 00043F73	SE11	SE11HowlingHalls	1	These zealots believe her to be some sort of savior, or deity, or something. Their doctrine is very confusing.	Somewhat mocking of this group.
FormID: 00043F73	SE11	SE11HowlingHalls	2	The most useful thing that I can tell you about Ciirta's followers is that they will not harm anyone who is wearing their robes.	Somewhat mocking of this group.
FormID: 00016B7E	SE11a	SE11HowlingHalls	0	A lot of history has this place. It was I who led the apostles to steal the stones from Cyrodiil when the original temple was destroyed.	Exceedingly proud of himself. Bragging.
FormID: 00016B7E	SE11a	SE11HowlingHalls	1	We rebuilt it here, as it was when it hosted its most famous guest. Sometimes at night, I can still hear Emperor Pelagius screaming.	Very happy at the idea of an insane emporer.
FormID: 00016B7F	SE11a	SE11HowlingHalls	0	Hundreds of years ago, this very building once served as a temple in Cyrodiil that sought to [QUOTE]cure[QUOTE] the mad. 	
FormID: 00016B7F	SE11a	SE11HowlingHalls	1	It was in this temple that Emperor Pelagius was taken during his madness. After his death in these very halls, the temple was destroyed.	
FormID: 00016B7F	SE11a	SE11HowlingHalls	2	We stole the stones from Cyrodiil and reassembled the temple here in the Shivering Isles.	
FormID: 00043F72	SE11	SE11CiirtaTopic	0	She is an interesting character indeed. She is one of the very few individuals in the Shivering Isles that is party to the secret of Sheogorath. 	
FormID: 00043F72	SE11	SE11CiirtaTopic	1	She once made her way into the throne room during the Greymarch and saw that Sheogorath was nowhere to be found.	
FormID: 00043F72	SE11	SE11CiirtaTopic	2	However, she did not recognize this event for what it was. She believes that Sheogorath had abandoned the Realm out of fear of Jyggalag's attack.	
FormID: 00043F72	SE11	SE11CiirtaTopic	3	So while she is party to the secret, she does not know its significance. She believed Sheogorath to be a traitor to His people.	
FormID: 00043F72	SE11	SE11CiirtaTopic	4	She believed it so strongly that she led a revolt against Sheogorath when He returned. She was imprisoned in the Howling Halls for her trouble.	
FormID: 0001A39A	SE11a	SE11CiirtaTopic	0	I thank you for your help in killing her. Now, I can lead my people towards the light. 	Happy that things have worked out in his favor.
FormID: 00016B81	SE11a	SE11CiirtaTopic	0	Ciirta is a fool, and a liar! She allows her hatred for Sheogorath to interfere with our journey toward the light! She must be stopped!	Frustrated and angry, but mostly meglomaniacal.
FormID: 0001A399	SE11a	SE11CiirtaTopic	0	I understand that she is no longer with us. The apostles will need another to lead them to the light. Now is my chance!	Devious
FormID: 00016B82	SE11a	SE11CiirtaTopic	0	Ciirta guides us to the light, but... her obsession with Sheogorath keeps us from achieving it! Ra'kheran, now he -- I've said too much.	Accidently reveals too much information.
FormID: 0001A394	SE11a	SE11CiirtaTopic	0	At last! We are free from Ciirta and her madness. Hail to Ra'kheran, the lightbringer!	Pleased at the turn of events.
FormID: 0001A397	SE11a	SE11CiirtaTopic	0	Ciirta's light has been darkened. Now is the time for another to rise and stand in her place.	Like a child lost in the woods.
FormID: 0001A398	SE11a	SE11CiirtaTopic	0	Her... her light has gone out. What will we do now? Are we damned to walk in darkness forever? Who will lead us?	Like a child lost in the woods.
FormID: 00016B85	SE11a	SE11CiirtaTopic	0	Ciirta is the lightbringer. She has seen things that we can only imagine. If you are to join us, you must speak with her.	Very proud of Ciirta.
FormID: 00016B73	SE11a	SE11CiirtaGreetingEnd2	0	Then you will die!	
FormID: 00016B72	SE11a	SE11CiirtaGreeting2b	0	And my eye is required to create an artifact, isn't it? Very well then. I have survived greater threats than you.	She speaks as if she already knows.
FormID: 00016B72	SE11a	SE11CiirtaGreeting2b	1	Come then, and I will show you that in the end, my light shall shine the brightest!	She will not allow Sheogorath's minion to defeat her.
FormID: 00016B71	SE11a	SE11CiirtaGreeting2a	0	My eye? You seek to remove the light from me? Why?	Trepedatious. She probably already knows the reason.
FormID: 00016B70	SE11a	SE11CiirtaGreeting1b	0	I could not abide Sheogorath's betrayal. He brought disharmony. He allowed the Greymarch to take us.	Angry and frustrated.
FormID: 00016B70	SE11a	SE11CiirtaGreeting1b	1	I gathered those who could see the light and I led a revolt against him. We were... slaughtered by his Dark Seducers. I alone was spared.	Defeated.
FormID: 00016B70	SE11a	SE11CiirtaGreeting1b	2	And in sparing me, Sheogorath made His final mistake. In this place, I will gather a new army and dethrone our coward god once and for all!	Cold and calculating. She will have her revenge.
FormID: 00016B6F	SE11a	SE11CiirtaGreeting2	0	He is? Then the Greymarch has begun again? If that is so, then why are you here?	Cautious.
FormID: 00016B6E	SE11a	SE11CiirtaGreeting1a	0	I did. When the Knights came, I fled to the city. As they marched and burned everything to ash, I found a way into the palace.	Confused and frustrated. She can't quite remember exactly what happened.
FormID: 00016B6E	SE11a	SE11CiirtaGreeting1a	1	I sought Sheogorath. This is His Realm, and I knew that He would protect us. And what did I find? The Throne of Madness -- empty!	Confused and frustrated. She can't quite remember exactly what happened.
FormID: 00016B6E	SE11a	SE11CiirtaGreeting1a	2	Sheogorath had fled! Left us all to die! I hid as the doors to the throne room burst open.	Confused and frustrated. She can't quite remember exactly what happened.
FormID: 00016B6E	SE11a	SE11CiirtaGreeting1a	3	I... I don't remember what happened afterwards. I woke up in the marshes and fled underground.	Confused and frustrated. She can't quite remember exactly what happened.
FormID: 00016B6C	SE11a	SE11CiirtaGreetingEnd1	0	Very well then! I will send you to darkness!	Furious
FormID: 00016B6D	SE11a	SE11CiirtaGreeting1	0	I sense why you have come. I can hear it in your very breath. You came as a herald of the false god Sheogorath.	
FormID: 00016B6D	SE11a	SE11CiirtaGreeting1	1	I know His secret. I have seen His empty throne -- seen it with my own eyes while New Sheoth burned in the grey fires of Order.	
FormID: 00016B6D	SE11a	SE11CiirtaGreeting1	2	Sheogorath refuses to protect us. Madgod? Bah! The Greymarch brings darkness. We seek light for all.

FormID: 00016D04	SE12	SE12RootDungeon	1	Normally the Fountainhead is a peaceful sanctuary. But there's no telling what changes the taint of Order may have wrought.	
FormID: 00016D04	SE12	SE12RootDungeon	2	Now, I fear that the Gnarls themselves may be accelerating the spread of Order throughout the Tree's roots. Be careful.	
FormID: 00016D03	SE12	SE12HaskillGreetC2	0	Somehow the forces of Order have poisoned the Pools of Mania and Dementia that feed the Font.	
FormID: 00016D03	SE12	SE12HaskillGreetC2	1	I suspect the traitor Thadon. Jyggalag has never had an original thought in his existence.	
FormID: 00016D03	SE12	SE12HaskillGreetC2	2	Be that as it may. You will have to enter the Fountainhead beneath the Tree and find the source of the poison.	
FormID: 00016EDD	SE12	SE12HaskillGreetC2	0	Somehow the forces of Order have poisoned the Pools of Mania and Dementia that feed the Tree.	
FormID: 00016EDD	SE12	SE12HaskillGreetC2	1	I suspect the traitor Syl. Jyggalag has never had an original thought in his existence.	
FormID: 00016EDD	SE12	SE12HaskillGreetC2	2	Be that as it may. You will have to enter the Fountainhead beneath the Tree and find the source of the poison.	
FormID: 00016D02	SE12	SE12HaskillGreetC1	0	This is true. Very little surprises me, but your successes against the advance of Order have left me astonished. Speechless.	
FormID: 00016D02	SE12	SE12HaskillGreetC1	1	Indeed, it is your very success that must have led Jyggalag to this unexpected avenue of attack. His usual approach is much less imaginative.	
FormID: 00016D01	SE12	SE12HaskillGreetB1	0	Yes. His agents must have found a way to poison the Font with Order.	
FormID: 00016D01	SE12	SE12HaskillGreetB1	1	Once the source of Madness becomes the Font of Order, Jyggalag has won.	
FormID: 00016D00	SE12	SE12HaskillGreetA3	0	Indeed. The Font is being Ordered. As goes the Font of Madness, so goes the Realm. Soon we will all be serving a new master.	
FormID: 00016CFF	SE12	SE12HaskillGreetA2	0	Order. The taint appeared only a short time ago, but it has spread quickly. I fear that soon we will all be serving a new master.	
FormID: 00016CFE	SE12	SE12HaskillGreetA1	0	You're having a bit of fun with me. Very good.	
FormID: 00016CFE	SE12	SE12HaskillGreetA1	1	My Lord of course noticed the Font when you arrived in the Palace. The Font of Madness, in the middle of the throne room.	
FormID: 00016CFE	SE12	SE12HaskillGreetA1	2	The Font which is unaccountably covered with crystals.	
FormID: 00016EA9	SE07B	SE07BRitual	0	Then everything is as it should be. The Ritual was followed, the blood brought to the Altar...	
FormID: 00017272	SE12	SE12FontofMadness	0	The Font flows with the sap of the Tree of Madness, which it draws up from deep beneath the palace.	
FormID: 00017272	SE12	SE12FontofMadness	1	The Fountainhead leads down to the Pools of Dementia and Mania, where the insanity of the Realm's inhabitants settles.	
FormID: 00017272	SE12	SE12FontofMadness	2	Jyggalag's minions must have introduced Order into the very wellspring of Madness. You must cleanse the Pools, or Order has won the war.	
FormID: 0001746F	SE10	SE10WhatHappened	0	Syl... the snake. She showed up, asked for a contingent of guards. Said there was trouble at the palace, and that we were needed.	
FormID: 0001746F	SE10	SE10WhatHappened	1	We were so focused on organizing quickly that by the time we realized she'd let Order in herself, it was too late. We were split up and picked off.	
FormID: 0001746F	SE10	SE10WhatHappened	2	But it doesn't matter anymore. The only thing that matters now is the Wellspring. We must reach it at once!

FormID: 0001823D	MS12	MS12RecoverYes	0	I never thought it possible. I mean... I had hoped... but to actually hold it in my hands. It's more beautiful than I imagined it.	
FormID: 0001823D	MS12	MS12RecoverYes	1	Congratulations. I had a feeling you were the right person for the job. And it seems I owe you a reward.	
FormID: 0001823D	MS12	MS12RecoverYes	2	This Akaviri ring was found with the messenger's diary. It awards the wearer with increased agility and resistance to harmful magic.	
FormID: 0001823D	MS12	MS12RecoverYes	3	It's known as the Ring of the Vipereye. I hope it serves you well in your future journeys.

FormID: 0001822A	MS12	MS12Diary	0	The messenger's diary will make a nice companion to the Madstone in my collection.	
FormID: 0001823B	MS12	MS12Diary	0	I paid several scouts to try and find the ruins at Pale Pass before I hired you. They were only able to locate the first of a series of landmarks.	
FormID: 0001823B	MS12	MS12Diary	1	These landmarks are mentioned within the diary. The one referred to as Dragonclaw Rock has been located. I'll mark it on your map.	
FormID: 0001823B	MS12	MS12Diary	2	The rest is up to you. My scouts reported bitter cold and dangerous creatures in the area, so they couldn't proceed.

FormID: 00018238	MS12	MS12DeclineMission	0	I'm not used to hearing no, but I admire your boldness. I won't force you to go, only to request that you reconsider in the future.

FormID: 00018239	MS12	MS12AcceptMission	0	I had a feeling you'd accept. Good. Then let me tell you how you're going to find the Madstone.	
FormID: 00018239	MS12	MS12AcceptMission	1	I've come into the possession of a diary written by an Akaviri messenger. I suspect that the text within can lead you to the ruins.	
FormID: 00018239	MS12	MS12AcceptMission	2	Here's a translation of the passages we could still read. It was quite damaged. I've also included a rough map that was drawn in the diary as well.	
FormID: 00018239	MS12	MS12AcceptMission	3	I'm also providing you with a unique key that was supposedly found with the diary. I'm assuming it will prove useful when you arrive at the site.	
FormID: 00018237	MS12	MS12Lost	0	Not quite. The Army of Reman knew that the organized Akaviri forces were commanded from a hidden post in the mountains.	
FormID: 00018237	MS12	MS12Lost	1	Rumors placed it in a snowy vale called Pale Pass. That's where Reman focused his attention.	
FormID: 00018237	MS12	MS12Lost	2	As his forces fought their way across the Jerall Mountains, the Akaviri suddenly surrendered. It was assumed they were overwhelmed and gave up.	
FormID: 00018237	MS12	MS12Lost	3	The only strange part was that the command post and Pale Pass were never found. It was dismissed as rumor and the Army of Reman celebrated.	
FormID: 00018237	MS12	MS12Lost	4	It's come to my attention that the post did exist and it happens to be the last reported location of the Draconian Madstone.	accentuate [QUOTE]did[QUOTE]
FormID: 00018236	MS12	MS12PaleNo	0	Back at the end of the First Era, raiders from the continent of Akavir attempted to gain a foothold here in Tamriel.	
FormID: 00018236	MS12	MS12PaleNo	1	At that time, the Empire was broken into smaller factions. Reman Cyrodiil decided to unify them and form an army to repel the Akaviri raiders.	
FormID: 00018236	MS12	MS12PaleNo	2	The force became known as the Army of Reman. The two armies clashed in what's now northern Cyrodiil. The Akaviri were strong and well supplied.	
FormID: 00018236	MS12	MS12PaleNo	3	But their greatest error was marching through Morrowind on the way to their objective and dismissing the response it would garner from Vivec.	
FormID: 00018236	MS12	MS12PaleNo	4	They didn't count on Lord Vivec forming an alliance with the Trident-Kings of the Dreugh. From Morrowind, he struck at their rear flank.	REC [QUOTE]Dreugh[QUOTE] is pronounced [QUOTE]Dreg[QUOTE], not [QUOTE]Drek[QUOTE]
FormID: 00018236	MS12	MS12PaleNo	5	Not only did this make the Akaviri fight on two fronts, it also cut off access to reinforcements and supplies from the sea.	
FormID: 00018235	MS12	MS12PaleYes	0	Well then, history lesson notwithstanding, I hope you can recover the Draconian Madstone.	
FormID: 00132AA3	MS12	PalePassTopic	0	With the information you have given me about Pale Pass, it could take scholars many years to amend the history books.

FormID: 00018230	MS12	DraconianMadstoneTopic	0	If you retreive the Draconian Madstone for me, I'll be happy to compensate you by rewarding you with another Akaviri artifact. Are you game?	
FormID: 00018233	MS12	DraconianMadstoneTopic	0	The stone is a fine bit of Akaviri craftsmanship. Worn like an amulet, this talisman is said to protect the wearer from poisons of any type.	
FormID: 00018233	MS12	DraconianMadstoneTopic	1	The Madstone appears as a snake coiled around and encircling itself. The eyes of the snake are supposed to be precious gems or some such.	
FormID: 00018233	MS12	DraconianMadstoneTopic	2	Through my sources, I've learned that the last reported location of the Madstone was the ruins at Pale Pass.	
FormID: 00018228	MSFIN	DraconianMadstoneTopic	0	The Madstone is finally mine. It's the pinnacle of my collection. Many thanks to you again.	
FormID: 00018232	MS12	MS12Stipend	0	Good point. Allow me to formally introduce myself. I'm Countess Narina Carvain. I assume you've noticed all of the Akaviri relics I'm displaying.	
FormID: 00018232	MS12	MS12Stipend	1	Well, it's safe to say I'm a collector of sorts. I've invested a great deal of time and money acquiring these bits of ancient history.	
FormID: 00018232	MS12	MS12Stipend	2	In fact, I'd be so bold as to proclaim my collection the most complete in all Cyrodiil; perhaps even beyond. Except for one thing.	
FormID: 00018232	MS12	MS12Stipend	3	A particular relic has eluded me for many years. Possessing this piece of Akaviri antiquity would make my collection complete.	
FormID: 00018232	MS12	MS12Stipend	4	I'm of course referring to The Draconian Madstone.

FormID: 00018704	SE08	SE08SheldenChoice2	0	What? Here? Are you kidding? I'm not staying here! If you don't want to help me, fine. I'll get out of here on my own.	Selfish, but frightened. Self-entitled.
FormID: 0004FE11	SE08	SE08SheldenChoice1	0	I'll do what I can to help. I... I like to hurt things. Maybe I can hurt these damned knights.	Unsure about his chances for survival, but willing to help.

FormID: 00018C88	SE08	SE08CommanderPlan3	0	Your insight is impressive. While we draw their attention here, you should be able to slip inside Xeddefen.	Gaining respect for the player after winning the battle.
FormID: 00018C88	SE08	SE08CommanderPlan3	1	Once inside, search for the source of the Spire's power. It must be underground somewhere. Once you find it, destroy it.	She isn't giving an order, but carefully wording a suggestion since she is speaking to her fcommander

FormID: 00018DB8	SE00	SE06GSWardenGreet2	0	Would that I could exact satisfaction upon you for that insult.	
FormID: 00018DB8	SE00	SE06GSWardenGreet2	1	But I am honor-bound to guard the doors of Cylarne, and so I will stay my hand. For now.

FormID: 00018DBA	SE00	SE06GSWardenGreet2	0	You have great faith in my powers of forebearance. Do not test me further, mortal.	
FormID: 00018DBB	SE00	SE06GSWardenGreet2	0	You are fortunate that my duty forbids me from satisfying my honor.	
FormID: 00018DC6	SE00	SE06GSWardenGreet2	0	You will answer for that with your blood, mortal!	
FormID: 00018DC3	SE06	SE06GSWardenGreet1	0	My pardon, lord. Receive this key, and with it free passage throughout the Shrine of the Flame of Agnon.	
FormID: 00018DFD	SE03A	SE03AInstExplainChoices	0	Each chamber presents two options. When you push the appropriate button, an event will unfold for the adventurers to experience. 	
FormID: 00018DFD	SE03A	SE03AInstExplainChoices	1	One is physically harmful... usually lethal traps or creatures... something relished by the residents of Dementia.	
FormID: 00018DFD	SE03A	SE03AInstExplainChoices	2	The other choice is more mental. They are designed to make the adventurers lose their grip on reality, much like the residents of Mania.	
FormID: 00018DFD	SE03A	SE03AInstExplainChoices	3	Of course, the introduction of spore gas with the Mania choices helps as well.	
FormID: 00018DFC	SE03A	SE03AInstDoYouHandle	0	Well, the dead will be disposed of, have no fear. That's my job.	
FormID: 00018DFC	SE03A	SE03AInstDoYouHandle	1	Those that are lucky enough to merely go insane will be granted a place in the Shivering Isles as a permanent resident.	
FormID: 00018DFB	SE03A	SE03AInstUntilWhen	0	You'll know you're done when they lie dead on the ground, or they are out of their minds.	
FormID: 00018DFB	SE03A	SE03AInstUntilWhen	1	Of course, any of their possessions you wish to keep are yours for the taking. I'll make sure you get them when you're done.	
FormID: 00018DFA	SE03A	SE03AInstMakeChoices	0	Simple. Wait until the adventurers are in position, and then press a button!	
FormID: 00018DFA	SE03A	SE03AInstMakeChoices	1	If they survived, they will proceed to the next chamber, and so on.	
FormID: 00018DFA	SE03A	SE03AInstMakeChoices	2	It's really quite ingenious!	
FormID: 00018DF9	SE03A	SE03AInstructions	0	As the adventurers make their way through Xedilian's chambers, they will encounter choices that you make in these control platforms.	
FormID: 00018DF9	SE03A	SE03AInstructions	1	All you need to do is decide what becomes of the adventurers. Will you drive them insane or will you pull the life from their bodies?	
FormID: 00018E5C	SE03A	SE03AInstructions	0	What else can I answer for you?	
FormID: 00018DF6	SE03A	SE03AWhatShould	0	The only thing we can do is let the adventurers complete a cycle through here. I'll be glad to help.	
FormID: 00018DF6	SE03A	SE03AWhatShould	1	I assume Sheogorath gave you the Manual of Xedilian. You can consult it for more information, or I can provide instructions.	
FormID: 00018DF7	SE03A	SE03ATellMeMore	0	Ever since that wretched Gatekeeper was made, Xedilian became redundant. It fell into disrepair and was eventually all but forgotten.	
FormID: 00018DF7	SE03A	SE03ATellMeMore	1	After only a few years passed, the Grummites began moving in. Ghastly things!	
FormID: 00018DF7	SE03A	SE03ATellMeMore	2	They mistook the Focus Crystals for some sort of religious symbols, and removed them from their rightful places.	
FormID: 00018DF7	SE03A	SE03ATellMeMore	3	This rendered the Resonator inert and Xedilian completely useless. Luckily, you came along and placed Xedilian back into operation.	
FormID: 00018DF5	SE03A	SE03AHowDoI	0	Yes, yes. I tend to ramble; you'll have to forgive me. If you have the Attenuator, then Sheogorath must have sent you.	
FormID: 00018DF5	SE03A	SE03AHowDoI	1	Xedilian would normally have sent you back to the entrance when you stepped on the pad in the Resonator Chamber.	
FormID: 00018DF5	SE03A	SE03AHowDoI	2	Since you're up here, I can only surmise that adventurers are already entering the dungeon as we speak.	
FormID: 00018DF8	SE03A	SE03AResonatorofJudgmentT	0	The Resonator works by drawing adventurers to itself with a sort of magical [QUOTE]siren's call[QUOTE].	
FormID: 00018DF8	SE03A	SE03AResonatorofJudgmentT	1	Sheogorath uses the Resonator to find the [QUOTE]cream of the crop[QUOTE] as he calls them; the best of the worst to populate the Isles.	
FormID: 00018DF8	SE03A	SE03AResonatorofJudgmentT	2	Quite clever, eh?	
FormID: 00018DF4	SE03A	SE03AXedilian	0	A wonder of engineering, is it not?	
FormID: 00018DF4	SE03A	SE03AXedilian	1	Xedilian is the ultimate test of mettle for the foolhardy adventurer that dares trespass into the Shivering Isles.	
FormID: 00018DF4	SE03A	SE03AXedilian	2	What they don't know is that they're being drawn to their doom, courtesy of the Resonator of Judgment.	
FormID: 00019843	SE03A	SE03AChamber	0	I'm afraid you've exhausted Xedilian's resources. This was the final chamber.	
FormID: 00019847	SE03A	SE03AChamber	0	The third chamber of Xedilian is the Chamber of Anathema. Its contents are designed to make sure its the final encounter.	
FormID: 00019847	SE03A	SE03AChamber	1	The adventurers will be subject to horrors beyond their imagination... visions of repugnance, death, and malevolence reside in this room.	
FormID: 00019847	SE03A	SE03AChamber	2	If you wish to bring ruin to your victims, you may choose to animate some of the corpses and watch as they satiate their hunger.	
FormID: 00019847	SE03A	SE03AChamber	3	Or, we can create the illusion of the adventurer dying and his spirit rising from his corpse. Good fun to be had for all!	
FormID: 00019847	SE03A	SE03AChamber	4	Then, just as suddenly as we kill him, we revive the adventurer.There are few minds that can stand this type of torture.	
FormID: 00018FF1	SE03A	SE03AChamber	0	The second chamber of Xedilian is the Chamber of Avarice.	
FormID: 00018FF1	SE03A	SE03AChamber	1	The adventurers will have to overcome their feelings of greed as they set their eyes upon the huge piles of treasure locked behind that gate.	
FormID: 00018FF1	SE03A	SE03AChamber	2	You may choose to spring a fire trap and cause them great harm as they stand before the gate.	
FormID: 00018FF1	SE03A	SE03AChamber	3	Or, you can fill the chamber with hundreds of keys and watch them frantically search for the correct one. Always a crowd pleaser.	
FormID: 00018E5D	SE03A	SE03AChamber	0	I will be happy to describe each chamber and explain the event that unfolds as we proceed through Xedilian.	
FormID: 00018E5E	SE03A	SE03AChamber	0	This first chamber is the Chamber of the Gnarl.	
FormID: 00018E5E	SE03A	SE03AChamber	1	At the touch of a button, you can cause a large group of tiny Gnarls to appear and attack the adventurers.	
FormID: 00018E5E	SE03A	SE03AChamber	2	Or, if you're feeling merciful, we can have the group terrorized by a seemingly lowly Gnarl that instantly grows to twice their size!	
FormID: 00018E5E	SE03A	SE03AChamber	3	The hallucinogenic spore gas we release into the chamber will help lull the victims into believing the creature means to kill them.	
FormID: 00018E5E	SE03A	SE03AChamber	4	Don't worry, its bark is far worse than its bite. Hahaha!	Jovial laugh, accentuate [QUOTE]bark[QUOTE] since the creature is a tree creature (har har).
FormID: 00018E5B	SE03A	SE03AInstEnough	0	As you wish.	
FormID: 00018E6E	SE08	SE08SheldenGreeting3	0	Oh, sorry. I wasn't aware that being a courageous hero was a requirement around here. 	Sarcastic, but still afraid.
FormID: 00018E6E	SE08	SE08SheldenGreeting3	1	Look, you may be a scamp's ass, but I'm offering you the chance to be the hero of Passwall.	Recalcitrent, but still cocky.
FormID: 00018E6E	SE08	SE08SheldenGreeting3	2	Escort me out of here, protect me, get me home, and those people will praise you more than you can imagine.	He genuinely thinks that he's giving you the chance of a lifetime.
FormID: 00018E6D	SE08	SE08SheldenGreeting2	0	This place is a nightmare! Knights everywhere, these priests, and whatever they've done to Felas! 	Horrified, but still selfish.
FormID: 00018E6D	SE08	SE08SheldenGreeting2	1	Listen. Those people in Passwall need me. Can you imagine how they'd ever get along if I died down here?	Cocky. They don't need him, he's just saving his own ass.
FormID: 00018E6C	SE08	SE08SheldenGreeting1	0	Every time I look for a way out, I get twisted around and end up back here. But I'm too smart for them. 	Surprised.
FormID: 00018E6C	SE08	SE08SheldenGreeting1	1	You seem to have no trouble, though. Look at you, barely a scratch! You'd be the perfect person to protect me!	He has devised a very clever plan to save his ass.
FormID: 00018E6A	SE08	SE08CommanderBattle03	0	Back to your positions! Don't break ranks! Hold! Hold!	Shouting orders during battle.

FormID: 00019AD0	SE06	SEFlameofAgnonTopic	0	The Flame of Agnon can only be lit by the immortal servants of Sheogorath: the Golden Saints and Dark Seducers of His creation.	
FormID: 00019AD0	SE06	SEFlameofAgnonTopic	1	In normal times, Sheogorath would simply command it and his servants would leap to sacrifice themselves upon the Altars of Rapture and Despair.

FormID: 00019AD0	SE06	SEFlameofAgnonTopic	3	I'm afraid you may have to be a little bit clever.	
FormID: 0009109F	SE06	SEFlameofAgnonTopic	0	It's what's used to light the Great Torch. Haven't we covered this? You'll find it in Cylarne, guarded by my Saints and Seducers.

FormID: 00019CD1	SE11a	SE11RakheranGreeting1b	2	Yes, I have heard of you. Tell me, is it true? Has Sheogorath sent you to kill Ciirta for her vendetta against Him?

FormID: 00019FCE	SE11a	SE11RakheranGreeting3b1	0	Very clever, Your Grace. Bring to me three Apostle daggers. Ciirta must be slain with the weapons of the light if I am to take her place. No other weapons.	This is how it must be. Period.
FormID: 00019FCE	SE11a	SE11RakheranGreeting3b1	1	But you must be discreet. Do not remove the robes, or you will be attacked. Even I will have to kill you, so I do not draw more suspicion to myself.	
FormID: 00019FCE	SE11a	SE11RakheranGreeting3b1	2	And be cautious of killing my allies. I cannot forgive that crime. You will know them, as they are also forbidden to carry daggers.	
FormID: 00019FCE	SE11a	SE11RakheranGreeting3b1	3	Will you help me bring the Apostles to the light? And help yourself?	Pleading and deceptive. He simple wants power for himself.

FormID: 00019FCB	SE11a	SE11RakheranGreeting3b	0	I require weapons. For myself and for the Apostles that will help me do the deed. But Ciirta already is suspicious of me.	
FormID: 00019FCB	SE11a	SE11RakheranGreeting3b	1	She has forbidden me and those who support me from carrying weapons. And suspicious would it look if we were to wander around gathering them.	Frustrated. 
FormID: 0008F12C	SE11a	SE11RakheranGreeting3a	0	Too long Ciirta has led us here. Always against Sheogorath! Always! But we are tired of her vendetta. 	Sinister and angry.
FormID: 0008F12C	SE11a	SE11RakheranGreeting3a	1	Ciirta brought us here with promises to show us the light, but always is about Sheogorath, is about revenge!	
FormID: 0008F12C	SE11a	SE11RakheranGreeting3a	2	Ciirta lied, but when she is done, I will lead the Acolytes to the light!	This isn't about lying at all, he simply wants power.

FormID: 00019FC9	SE11a	SE11RakheranGreeting2b	1	But, there are those of us here who want her gone as well, yes. Those of us who think that maybe we could lead better then she does.	He thinks that he is very clever.
FormID: 00019FC9	SE11a	SE11RakheranGreeting2b	2	So, if you will help me, I will help you. Ciirta will die and you will not need to lift a finger. Then you can take whatever you need and go.	He thinks that he is very clever.
FormID: 00019FC8	SE11a	SE11RakheranGreeting2a	0	I knew it! No one can fool Ra'kheran. I am the wisest here, more wise even than Ciirta. And that is why she must go, yes.	Very proud of himself.
FormID: 00019FC8	SE11a	SE11RakheranGreeting2a	1	And you, if you help me, then you can have what you want and no need to risk your neck, yes?	He thinks that he is very clever.
FormID: 00019FCA	SE11a	SE11RakheranGreeting2a	0	Clever you are, but I can sense a liar. No matter, I do not care to know why you are here; I only care that you wish Ciirta harm.	Very proud of himself.
FormID: 00019FCA	SE11a	SE11RakheranGreeting2a	1	I, too, want to see her dead. And others here have had enough of her, yes. We wish the light, and keep it from us, she does.	Frustrated and angry, but mostly meglomaniacal.
FormID: 00019FCA	SE11a	SE11RakheranGreeting2a	2	If you will help me, you can have what you want, and we can have what we want. Everyone is happy... except Ciirta.	He thinks that he is very clever.

FormID: 0001CE9D	DANamira	AngaTOPIC	0	Hallowed ground, home of the Forgotten Ones. A deep hole of shadow and despair. A truly wondrous place.	
FormID: 0001CE9C	DANamira	TheForgottenOnesTOPIC	0	Blessed are the Forgotten Ones, Chosen of Namira. In squalor they thrive, wallowing in filth, low and repulsive, darlings of Namira.	
FormID: 0001CE98	DANamira	ShrineofNamiraTOPIC	0	A place of blessed darkness. A holy place where we may worship in our wretchedness. Why are you here?	
FormID: 0001C154	TGInfo	TGRules	0	First, never steal from another member of the guild.	
FormID: 0001C154	TGInfo	TGRules	1	Second, never kill anyone on the job. This is not the Dark Brotherhood. Animals and monsters can be slain if necessary.	
FormID: 0001C154	TGInfo	TGRules	2	Third, don't steal from the poor. The peasants and beggars are under the personal protection of the Gray Fox, particularly here on the Waterfront.	
FormID: 0001C153	TG01BestThief	TG01MethredhelCheated	0	Stop whining, Methredhel. You'll get another chance soon enough. Why should the Thieves Guild turn down a recruit for stealing?	Annoyed.
FormID: 0001C152	TG01BestThief	TG01MethredhelAccepted	0	Methredhel, you have earned the right to join the Thieves Guild.	Do NOT rerecord. I only changed puncuation.[CRLF][CRLF]Proud.
FormID: 0001C1C7	MS14	MS14NoMoreBrush	0	Thank you. You're truly kind to help someone you've just met. The only thing standing in our way are the painted trolls.	
FormID: 0001C1C6	MS14	MS14TruepaintTopic	0	Very well. The Brush showed up several years ago in the possession an artist who was serving in the Arnesian War of 396.	
FormID: 0001C1C6	MS14	MS14TruepaintTopic	1	It seems an errant fireball had exploded next to him, and he lost the use of both arms. He was a stubborn man who didn't want to give up his talent.	
FormID: 0001C1C6	MS14	MS14TruepaintTopic	2	Being a devout follower of Dibella, he prayed to her for something that would allow him to express himself once more.	
FormID: 0001C1C6	MS14	MS14TruepaintTopic	3	She heard his plea, and gifted him with the Brush. It's said the bristles of the Brush are woven from Dibella's own hair.	
FormID: 0001C1C6	MS14	MS14TruepaintTopic	4	That injured man was my father. He passed the Brush on to me, and I intend to pass it along to my kin one day. Did you want to know how it works?	
FormID: 00061423	MS14	MS14TivelaHeard	0	Well yes, of course. Why are you asking me these silly questions twice?	
FormID: 0001C1C5	MS14	MS14TivelaHeard	0	Yes. Rythe likes to work in his studio with the door locked, so no one can disturb him.	
FormID: 0001C1C5	MS14	MS14TivelaHeard	1	He usually comes out to eat dinner and sleep, but two days ago, he didn't come out at all. At first, I wasn't worried. He does that occasionally.	
FormID: 0001C1C5	MS14	MS14TivelaHeard	2	But when he didn't come out for a full day, I unlocked the studio with the key he said to use only in emergencies. It turned out he wasn't inside!	
FormID: 0001C1C5	MS14	MS14TivelaHeard	3	I'm sure he never left that room. So I have no idea where he's gone. Please. Help me find Rythe. I love him dearly, and I am so worried.	
FormID: 0001C1CC	MS14	MS14ReturnHome	0	I will rest, but I must take care of our guest first.	
FormID: 0001C1CD	MS14	MS14ReturnHome	0	Come, you must need food and rest.	REC
FormID: 0001C1CE	MS14	MS14ReturnHome	0	If it wasn't for my friend here, you'd be right.	
FormID: 0001C1CF	MS14	MS14ReturnHome	0	Rythe! Oh my love! You are home safe... I was so afraid...	
FormID: 0001C1E0	MS14	MS14ReturnHome	0	Tivela!	
FormID: 0001C497	MS12	MS12TolganGreet	0	Countess Carvain would prefer if you speak to her in person. She also said to present you with this stipend as a taste of things to come.	
FormID: 0001C497	MS12	MS12TolganGreet	1	My Lady holds court from 8 in the morning until 6 in the evening each day. That would be the best time to see her.	
FormID: 0001C492	MS12	MS12CmdrAnswer3	0	Then prepare for battle! I'll not let this fort fall to the dogs of Reman!	
FormID: 0001C490	MS12	MS12CmdrAnswer2	0	Well done, soldier. Your mission is complete, and you have my thanks. Now we may rest. Long live the Akavir!	
FormID: 0001C491	MS12	MS12CmdrAnswer2	0	Lies do not befit a soldier of Akavir!	
FormID: 0001C48F	MS12	MS12CmdrAnswer1	0	How dare you address me that way, soldier! Your insolence will not be tolerated!	
FormID: 0002B533	MSConversations	MS18Convo	0	I don't think I'm going to make it!	
FormID: 0002B534	MSConversations	MS18Convo	0	I could use a hand here!	
FormID: 0001CB75	MSConversations	MS18Convo	0	Why not? We can't just let those creatures live, and no one else is going to do anything about it, so we should get going!	
FormID: 0001CB76	MSConversations	MS18Convo	0	Patience, Antus. He'll be here as soon as he can. Don't be so anxious to go rushing into battle.	
FormID: 0001CB77	MSConversations	MS18Convo	0	Why isn't he here yet? What's taking him so long? He knew we were coming back for him...	
FormID: 0002B1C9	MSConversations	MS18Convo	0	Father's not scared - don't you dare say that! You'll see when he gets here. I'll ask him, and then you'll see!	
FormID: 0002B1CA	MSConversations	MS18Convo	0	I'm here because even though I'm afraid, I know that we have to do this. Father would feel the same way.	
FormID: 0001CB78	MSConversations	MS18Convo	0	If you don't want to be doing this, then why are you even here? Father and I can handle this.	
FormID: 0001CB79	MSConversations	MS18Convo	0	This is no joke, Antus, and it's nothing to be excited about.	
FormID: 0001CB7A	MSConversations	MS18Convo	0	I just can't wait. This is going to be the greatest fight ever!	
FormID: 0001CB7B	MSConversations	MS18Convo	0	Antus, calm down. We'll be leaving soon enough.	
FormID: 0001CE99	DANamira	DANamiraChoice2	0	Then leave this place. Namira has no business with you.	
FormID: 0001CE9A	DANamira	DANamiraChoice1	0	You do? You are too pretty to worship in this place. People like you. Like to hear you talk. When you are more loathesome, you may return.	
FormID: 0001CE9B	DANamira	DANamiraChoice1	0	You do? Perhaps you should. You are repulsive, displeasing to the eye. Namira might find favor in you. Approach.	
FormID: 0001E7EB	MS29	MS29ShadyDeal	0	Don't worry, it will be very soon. Now get outta' here.	
FormID: 0001E7EE	MS29	MS29ShadyDeal	0	Fine. You made your point. Contact me when you have the items, and we'll meet again.	
FormID: 0001E7F1	MS29	MS29ShadyDeal	0	You cut back now, and I'm going to take my business elsewhere. Or maybe pay a visit to that Jensine and tell her about your little scheme.	
FormID: 0001E7F3	MS29	MS29ShadyDeal	0	Well, that Society is putting more pressure on me. So maybe we better cut back for a while.	
FormID: 0001E7F4	MS29	MS29ShadyDeal	0	You take what I get. I get notice at the last second, and I have to jump on it. No time to be picky about it.	
FormID: 0001E7F5	MS29	MS29ShadyDeal	0	Same assortment of things? I mean, I have enough clothing for now.	
FormID: 0001E7FA	MS29	MS29ShadyDeal	0	Well, just shut up and listen to me. The next shipment will be sooner than I expected. Just have the money ready.	
FormID: 0001E7FB	MS29	MS29ShadyDeal	0	Sorry, I am not used to this kind of meeting. It always makes me nervous.	
FormID: 0001E7FC	MS29	MS29ShadyDeal	0	Shhhh, not so loud. How many time have I told you that?	
FormID: 0001E846	MS29	MS29ShadyDeal	0	That you, Agarmir?	
FormID: 0001D049	MS29	MS29InvNice	0	Well thank you! It's not only a fine assortment of goods, but a bit of a treasure trove; you never know what I'll have in stock.	
FormID: 0001D049	MS29	MS29InvNice	1	I can see by the look on your face you wonder where I get all these fantastic items. I'll tell you what I tell everyone else who asks.	
FormID: 0001D049	MS29	MS29InvNice	2	It's all about who you know. My sources are good, but they are secret.	
FormID: 0001D049	MS29	MS29InvNice	3	Anyway, have fun looking around, and when you are ready to buy, give me a shout.	
FormID: 0001D048	MS29	MS29StopAgarmir2	0	Yes, you do that. And in the meantime, I'll decide what to do with all of these ill-gotten things. I'm so sorry.	
FormID: 0001D047	MS29	MS29StopAgarmir	0	Yes! That's the least I can do.	
FormID: 0001D047	MS29	MS29StopAgarmir	1	First and foremost, I will never meet with him again. I can promise you that. Secondly, I remember him mentioning a place he had to be this very day.	
FormID: 0001D047	MS29	MS29StopAgarmir	2	Ummm... yes. That's right. He said that he wouldn't be able to do anything else, as he had something important to do.	
FormID: 0001D047	MS29	MS29StopAgarmir	3	You don't think he would dig up another... oh no, he wouldn't. But I guess he has been. Oh my. What have I done?	
FormID: 0001CEF7	MG06Bruma	MG06JskarConv	0	What? Oh... err, no. I'm afraid not. No sign at all.	
FormID: 000836CC	MG06Bruma	Prank	0	Well, it was fun while it lasted. I'll have to start thinking up something new to try.	
FormID: 0001EF7D	MG06Bruma	Prank	0	It was a good idea, wasn't it? I wonder how long she'll spend trying to figure out where she put it down.	REC
FormID: 00031038	MG06Bruma	Prank	0	You've got Jeanne's book, I see. All right, then. I'll just take that from you.... Meet me here in the living quarters just after 10 PM.	REC
FormID: 0001EF7E	MG06Bruma	Prank	0	You've got Jeanne's book, I see. All right, then. I'll just take that from you.... Meet me in the living quarters just after 10 PM.	REC
FormID: 0001CEEA	MG06Bruma	Prank	0	Just go unlock Jeanne's desk with that spell I taught you.. Find her Manual of Spellcraft, and bring it here to me.	REC
FormID: 0001CEEA	MG06Bruma	Prank	1	Her room should be easy to find. It's the only one upstairs that has a door. Just one more privilege she doesn't deserve.	
FormID: 000302D5	MG06Bruma	Prank	0	Heh. Really, you're going to love this.	
FormID: 000302D5	MG06Bruma	Prank	1	I'll teach you a spell to unlock things. What you need to do is get into Jeanne's desk, and bring me her Manual of Spellcraft, okay?	REC
FormID: 000302D5	MG06Bruma	Prank	2	Her room is upstairs; make sure no one sees you. You do that for me, and I'll make sure you can find J'skar.	
FormID: 0001E7E6	MS29	FromTheDead	0	You are a damn fool.	
FormID: 0001D038	MS29	FromTheDead	0	I have no idea what you're talking about, but you have a sick mind. Get away from me.	
FormID: 0001E83D	MS29	FromTheDead	0	I hope everyone can forgive me for not doing a better job checking up on my sources.	
FormID: 0001D031	MS29	FromTheDead	0	You just take care of Agarmir, and I will be sure these things are disposed of properly.	
FormID: 0001D032	MS29	FromTheDead	0	I... can't believe what I'm seeing in this book. I'm mortified. To think these things here were once on the bodies of the recently deceased.	
FormID: 0001D032	MS29	FromTheDead	1	It's just too horrible to comprehend. I don't even know what to say. I guess an apology is not enough. What can I do?	
FormID: 0001D036	MS29	FromTheDead	0	Are you implying that my merchandise comes from the deceased?	
FormID: 0001D036	MS29	FromTheDead	1	Your story is ridiculous. This sounds like some lie created by Jensine and her damned [QUOTE]society[QUOTE] to have me run out of town.	
FormID: 0001D036	MS29	FromTheDead	2	Please... if you don't want to buy something, then just leave. Your wild accusations are upsetting me.	
FormID: 0001D043	MS29	FromTheDead	0	The very thought of what Agarmir was doing sickens me. I hope those poor souls rest in peace now that this is over.	
FormID: 0001D0B2	MS29	FromTheDead	0	Words... fail me. I knew that Thoronir obtained his goods through dark dealings, but I never would have imagined this.	
FormID: 0001D0B2	MS29	FromTheDead	1	As sickened as I am, I will not tell the City Watch until you have confirmed this theory and brought us the proof we need.	
FormID: 0001CE03	MS29	FromTheDead	0	By the Divines... I can't believe this! They would dare defile the dead to make a profit? The City Watch will hear of this.	
FormID: 0001CE03	MS29	FromTheDead	1	You should take this book to Thoronir. Confronted with this, he may just see things differently.	
FormID: 0001D0B3	MS29	FromTheDead	0	Without any solid evidence to back that accusation up, you don't have cause to assume that is where Agarmir gets his merchandise.	
FormID: 0001D044	MS29	MS29InvGet	0	Well, that would be a trade secret. I can't divulge how I pass the great savings on to you, now can I?	
FormID: 0001D044	MS29	MS29InvGet	1	Just like a baker not revealing his best recipes, I must keep my sources anonymous or every merchant in town would use them.	
FormID: 0001D044	MS29	MS29InvGet	2	Suffice to say, they are quite reliable and low cost. That way, you walk out with a full coinpurse!	
FormID: 0001D045	MS29	MS29InvStolen	0	You have some nerve! Where do you come off accusing me of something you know nothing about?	
FormID: 0001D045	MS29	MS29InvStolen	1	Now, either buy something or get out.	
FormID: 0001D24D	MS23	MS23HowFind	0	I would start by searching his home. He hasn't been there for days, so it should be safe. Return to us here if you have questions. We meet at night.	
FormID: 0001E0B9	MS23	VampireTopic	0	Horrid creatures. I hope we never see one in the Imperial City again.	
FormID: 0001D4B0	MS23	VampireTopic	0	As you know, the vampire can't remain in sunlight. I'd wager that you'll never see Seridur outside during that time of day.	
FormID: 0001E071	MS23	VampireTopic	0	I suppose you must decide what to do. Are you going to kill me?	
FormID: 000947B6	MS23	VampireTopic	0	Vampires? Why would you ask me about those filthy creatures?	slightly nervously
FormID: 0001D4B4	MS23	VampireTopic	0	You may want to see if Grey-Throat or Gilen have done more research.	
FormID: 0001D4B6	MS23	VampireTopic	0	I believe that Grey-Throat and Gilen may have more information for you regarding these creatures.	
FormID: 0001D245	MS23	VampireTopic	0	Vampires are nasty creatures. They drink the blood of others to conceal their true nature. Such trickery makes them difficult to find.	
FormID: 0001D245	MS23	VampireTopic	1	You may ask Gilen Norvalo or Grey-Throat about these creatures as well. They've learned much.	
FormID: 0001D24B	MS23	VampireTopic	0	Our goal is to root out the vampires that live in our fair city. So far, we've been unsuccessful finding one until now.	
FormID: 0001D24B	MS23	VampireTopic	1	It's come to the Order's attention that Temple District resident Roland Jenseric is a vampire, and has already claimed one victim.	
FormID: 0001D24B	MS23	VampireTopic	2	That's where you come in. We want you to slay this vampire and cleanse the city of his filth before he can feed or kill again.	
FormID: 0001DA6A	MS23	VampireTopic	0	I'm afraid there isn't much more I can tell you. Perhaps one of our books can answer any more questions you may have?	
FormID: 0001D4BB	MS23	VampireTopic	0	Normal weapons won't harm a vampire, they must be enchanted. Make sure you're equipped with such an item.	
FormID: 0001D4BC	MS23	VampireTopic	0	I've learned some more information. Vampires are immune to paralysis spells and common diseases. I hope that helps in some way.	
FormID: 0001D4BE	MS23	VampireTopic	0	It's said that the bite of a vampire has the chance of infecting the victim. If this occurs, they'll become a vampire in a few days. Be cautious.	
FormID: 0001DA72	MS23	VampireTopic	0	Touching a vampire, or even the corpse of a vampire, can result in infection. Do be careful! If you want to know more, browse our library.	
FormID: 0001D4BF	MS23	VampireTopic	0	Vampires rarely live alone. They tend to have others of their ilk around them for protection.	
FormID: 0001D4C0	MS23	VampireTopic	0	Vampires have a weakness to fire. You may wish to use this to your advantage.	
FormID: 0001D244	MS23	VampireTopic	0	The vampire cannot exist in the daylight for long. As the sun's rays strike his flesh, it will burn as if on fire.	
FormID: 0001DB21	MS23	VampireTopic	0	Vampires? Hahaha! You have been speaking to Gilen. That silly old man keeps reading books about those creatures.	
FormID: 0001DB21	MS23	VampireTopic	1	I hope he hasn't gotten you wrapped up in some foolish errand.	
FormID: 0001DA5E	MSFIN	VampireTopic	0	At least there are a few less vampires in the world now. Well done. But there are more of these creatures that still roam Cyrodiil.	
FormID: 0001DA5E	MSFIN	VampireTopic	1	If any of our books can help you in the cause of destroying more, you're welcome to read them.	
FormID: 0001DA5E	MSFIN	VampireTopic	2	Since you're an honorary member of the Order, if you bring back proof you've slain a vampire, we'd be glad to compensate you.	
FormID: 0001DA5E	MSFIN	VampireTopic	3	Bring back the vampire dust from their remains. That should be proof enough.	
FormID: 0001E0CC	MSFIN	VampireTopic	0	Excellent! Another vampire has been slain. Here's your reward.	
FormID: 0001E0CD	MSFIN	VampireTopic	0	Return to me when you have slain another vampire, and the Order will gladly reward you.	
FormID: 0001DA61	MSFIN	VampireTopic	0	Our library is yours, friend.	
FormID: 0001DA66	MS23	RolandJensericTopic	0	The Order welcomes him.	
FormID: 0001D4B2	MS23	RolandJensericTopic	0	I knew it. Like I said before, a vampire wouldn't hide in a cabin. It'd be more like a cave or some other dank place.	
FormID: 0001D4B3	MS23	RolandJensericTopic	0	Odd. A cabin is an unusual hideout for a vampire. They prefer dank caves and the like. Much darker and no need to block out windows.	
FormID: 0001D4B5	MS23	RolandJensericTopic	0	Roland was always a quiet man. It was only recently he'd met that young lady. Poor girl. We must avenge her death.	
FormID: 0001DA6C	MS23	RolandJensericTopic	0	He'll make a fine replacement for Seridur. It's the least we can do.	
FormID: 0001D4B7	MS23	RolandJensericTopic	0	Ashame he wasn't there. I thought that you'd be able to put an end to this madness.	
FormID: 0001D4B8	MS23	RolandJensericTopic	0	If I were you, I'd go to the cabin in the daytime. That way, if he begins to overpower you, the outside can be a sanctuary.	
FormID: 0001D4B9	MS23	RolandJensericTopic	0	Roland was very much the loner. He never married, and was rarely seen outside his house. I'm surprised his secret wasn't discovered sooner.	
FormID: 0001D4BD	MS23	RolandJensericTopic	0	If you wish to find out more about Roland, try asking Gilen or Grey-Throat, they knew him.	
FormID: 0001D4C1	MS23	RolandJensericTopic	0	I wasn't aware he had a cabin outside of the city. Perhaps that's where he lures his victims. Be careful, he may have others with him.	
FormID: 0001D4C1	MS23	RolandJensericTopic	1	I'm afraid we cannot go with you to this remote location. Fighting is not our specialty. Watch yourself... vampires are known to be crafty.	
FormID: 0001D246	MS23	RolandJensericTopic	0	His home is located in the Temple District. Right across the garden from my home in fact. Ironic, isn't it?	
FormID: 0001D24C	MS23	RolandJensericTopic	0	A few nights ago, I was roaming the city as I often do, looking for any signs of a vampire. As I headed passed Roland's house I heard a cry.	
FormID: 0001D24C	MS23	RolandJensericTopic	1	I rushed into the back garden to find Roland struggling with a woman he'd been courting. I tried to intervene, but he was too strong.	
FormID: 0001D24C	MS23	RolandJensericTopic	2	He threw his lover to the ground and turned his attention on me. Luckily, I managed to run back into the street and escape his grasp.	
FormID: 0001D24C	MS23	RolandJensericTopic	3	I hid for a while and then returned to the garden. Roland was gone and the woman was dead. She had two puncture marks on the nape of her neck.	
FormID: 0001D24C	MS23	RolandJensericTopic	4	That's when I realized he was a vampire. The Order needs to you to track him and destroy him.	
FormID: 0001DB23	MS23	RolandJensericTopic	0	Don't really know him. He lives across the way from Seridur I think.	
FormID: 0001DA63	MSFIN	RolandJensericTopic	0	He's a fine man, and an honored brother.	
FormID: 0001DA64	MSFIN	RolandJensericTopic	0	I never would have guessed that Roland was a vampire. I could have sworn I saw him walk in daylight.	
FormID: 0001DA67	MSFIN	RolandJensericTopic	0	I'm pleased to call him brother.	
FormID: 0001DA6B	MSFIN	RolandJensericTopic	0	A shame he had to die. Before he turned, he was a fine man.	
FormID: 0001DA71	MSFIN	RolandJensericTopic	0	We shall never speak of him again.	
FormID: 0001D248	MS23	MS23FollowSeridur	0	Splendid. Watch your step.	
FormID: 0001D247	MS23	MS23SeridurGreet	0	Likewise. Sorry to send Gilen's wife to get you in that manner, but it seemed safer if we weren't seen on the streets right now.	
FormID: 0001D247	MS23	MS23SeridurGreet	1	If you'll come with me.	
FormID: 0001D4CA	MS23	MS23SeridurNotYet	0	Hmmm. He must have known we'd look there. Search around town and see if you can find any more information.	
FormID: 0001D4C9	MS23	MS23KillNoRoland	0	Thank you. I'm happy you gave me a chance to explain.	
FormID: 0001D4C8	MS23	MS23KillRoland	0	Then, I'll fight you until my last breath. I won't surrender and admit to a crime I didn't commit!	
FormID: 0001D4C7	MS23	MS23RolandAuthority	0	I panicked. By the time I awoke, her body was gone. I knew Seridur was a respected member of the community.	
FormID: 0001D4C7	MS23	MS23RolandAuthority	1	They'd never believe he was a vampire. I retreated here to the cabin to collect my thoughts.	
FormID: 0001D4C6	MS23	MS23RolandSad	0	Yes. I must let someone else know. That night, I decided to follow Relfina. I wanted to see where she went on her walks.	
FormID: 0001D4C6	MS23	MS23RolandSad	1	When she stopped in the garden, and Seridur stepped out of the shadows, my heart sank. Then, suddenly, he was upon her!	
FormID: 0001D4C6	MS23	MS23RolandSad	2	She seemed entranced as he wrapped his arms around her and sank his teeth into her neck. I burst from my hiding place and attacked Seridur.	
FormID: 0001D4C6	MS23	MS23RolandSad	3	He became startled for a moment and tossed Relfina aside. She fell to the ground and I heard a sickening crack as her head struck a stone.	Say last line with a touch of sadness.
FormID: 0001D4C6	MS23	MS23RolandSad	4	I was no equal to Seridur. He knocked me down in one quick movement. As I lost consciousness, I saw him laugh and then run away.	
FormID: 0001D4C6	MS23	MS23RolandSad	5	Now I know why he didn't finish me that night. He wanted to cast suspicions on me instead.	
FormID: 0001D4C5	MS23	MS23RolandCalm	0	I - I'm sorry. I've been hiding up here in this cabin and I've forgotten my manners. Try and understand. I loved her, I'd never harm her!	
FormID: 0001D4C5	MS23	MS23RolandCalm	1	Relfina was the love of my life. For the first time, I had a positive outlook. Then I saw Seridur looking at her with those coveting eyes.	Say last line venomously.
FormID: 0001D4C5	MS23	MS23RolandCalm	2	When she started taking walks in the garden at night, I became suspicious. I didn't want to lose her. I should have trusted her... oh, Relfina....	
FormID: 0001DA5A	MS23	SeridurTopic	0	Seridur? He comes in from time-to-time. Usually it's when he's out shopping. He always comes in with a large amount of travel food in his bag.	
FormID: 0001DA5A	MS23	SeridurTopic	1	Then sometimes he buys a few books. I asked him once about it, and he said that he goes out of the city on business trips.	
FormID: 0001DA5A	MS23	SeridurTopic	2	I think I overheard him once mention Memorial Cave to another patron of mine, but he never talked to me about it directly.	
FormID: 0001E0B2	MS23	SeridurTopic	0	I'm not really at liberty to discuss my customers with stangers.	
FormID: 0001DA5B	MS23	SeridurTopic	0	He was a traitor. Thanks to you, the Order lives on. Long live the Order!	
FormID: 0001E0B3	MS23	SeridurTopic	0	Seridur said we should meet without him for a few days. He said something about doing field research? I'm sure he'll return soon.	
FormID: 0001DA5C	MS23	SeridurTopic	0	Seridur is an honorable man. Forming the Order shows just how much he cares about the Imperial City and protecting its people.	
FormID: 0001DA5D	MS23	SeridurTopic	0	I'm astounded that the very thing we decided to fight turned out to be in our midst.	
FormID: 0001E0B4	MS23	SeridurTopic	0	Oh, I believe he left a message with Grey-Throat. Something about not being here for a few days?	
FormID: 0001DA60	MS23	SeridurTopic	0	Seridur? He founded this group a few years ago. I was impressed with his knowledge of vampires.	
FormID: 0001DA60	MS23	SeridurTopic	1	When we decided to make the group official, Seridur offered his basement as our headquarters. Quite nice, isn't it?	
FormID: 0001DA62	MS23	SeridurTopic	0	Let us never speak of that abomination again.	
FormID: 0001DA69	MS23	SeridurTopic	0	He's dead? Thank goodness! I feared I'd never be able to leave here, or worse, that he would come for me. I can finally return home.	
FormID: 0001DA69	MS23	SeridurTopic	1	The ironic thing is that I think the Order of the Virtuous Blood should continue its work. Perhaps I'll speak to the others.	
FormID: 0001DA69	MS23	SeridurTopic	2	Yes, I think that the Order will live on. Give me time to make arrangements, and meet me in Seridur's basement.	Say with resolution... like he just decided.
FormID: 0001D4C2	MS23	SeridurTopic	0	I know about Seridur and his [QUOTE]secret order.[QUOTE] What better way for a vampire to hide than to pretend he hunts them?	
FormID: 0001D4C2	MS23	SeridurTopic	1	You may want to speak to Phintias at the First Edition bookshop in the Market District of the city. I know he goes there occasionally.	
FormID: 0001D4C2	MS23	SeridurTopic	2	I doubt that he's told Gilen and Grey-Throat anything, but you could always try.	
FormID: 0001D4C4	MS23	SeridurTopic	0	I can't believe him! I knew he would try and pin this on me! If only I could get my hands on him...	
FormID: 0001DB22	MS23	SeridurTopic	0	Seridur is a nice enough fellow. For an Altmer, that is. I think he and Gilen, and that Argonian, Grey-Throat, have some kind of a club.	
FormID: 0001DB22	MS23	SeridurTopic	1	They're very serious about it, but I'm sure it's just some boys night out kind of a thing.	
FormID: 0001D4D2	TGInfo	TGDoyen	0	The Doyen are the hands and eyes of the guildmaster. You take your orders from them. You get your favors from them.	
FormID: 0001D4D2	TGInfo	TGDoyen	1	The current Doyen are Armand Christophe and S'krivva.	
FormID: 0001D4D3	TGInfo	TGDoyen	0	The Doyen are the hands and eyes of the guildmaster. You take your orders from them. You get your favors from them.	
FormID: 0001D4D3	TGInfo	TGDoyen	1	I am one Doyen and S'krivva is the other.	Do NOT re-record. I fixed a grammar problem but the voice actor read it properly.
FormID: 0001D4D4	TGInfo	TGDoyen	0	The Doyen are the eyes and claws of the guildmaster. As a hunter, you take orders from them, and you get your favors from them.	
FormID: 0001D4D4	TGInfo	TGDoyen	1	This one is a Doyen. Armand Christophe is a Doyen.	
FormID: 0001D4D0	TGInfo	TGStealingFromGuild	0	You are removed from the guild. You must pay a fine to one of the guild Doyen to get back in.	
FormID: 0001D4CF	TGInfo	TGWhatIsBloodPrice	0	Breaking any of the three rules means expulsion from the Thieves Guild. If you commit murder, you must pay the blood price to rejoin the guild.	
FormID: 0001D4CF	TGInfo	TGWhatIsBloodPrice	1	Blood price is for each person slain. You can pay any of the guild Doyen.	
FormID: 0001EC27	SE08	SE08PlaceGuardsHelp	0	Speak to each of the Mazken to give them orders.	Gruff. Military.
FormID: 0001EC27	SE08	SE08PlaceGuardsHelp	1	The front line will arm themselves with axes of war. They will hold the line against the enemy's charge.	Gruff. Military.
FormID: 0001EC27	SE08	SE08PlaceGuardsHelp	2	Those who you designate as archers will head to the rear and keep their distance when the enemy draws close.	Gruff. Military.
FormID: 0001EC27	SE08	SE08PlaceGuardsHelp	3	Those with blades and shields will hold the flank. When the enemy draws near, they will close in and attack.	Gruff. Military.

FormID: 0001DA70	MS23	MS23RolandDead	0	Excellent. I knew you wouldn't disappoint the Order. Here's the reward that was promised. However, I must ask that you reveal nothing about us.	
FormID: 0001DA70	MS23	MS23RolandDead	1	You've done a great service for the Imperial City, and you should be proud.	
FormID: 0001DA6E	MS23	MS23SeridurWalkInt	0	Then I'll be on my way. Meet me back at my home tomorrow evening if you'd like. For now, I need some time to myself.	
FormID: 0001DA6D	MS23	MS23MemCave	0	Yes. It's outside of the Imperial City. I heard it's a place where many of the heroes from past wars are buried. Sort of a subterranean graveyard.	
FormID: 0001DA6D	MS23	MS23MemCave	1	I just assumed Seridur had a relative that died and is buried there. Not many people go out there anymore, as the route is dangerous.	REC
FormID: 0001DA6D	MS23	MS23MemCave	2	But Seridur is a stubborn one. Hehe. Takes integrity for a man to risk his own life to honor the fallen. I admire him for that.	
FormID: 0001DA6D	MS23	MS23MemCave	3	I looked it up once in an old atlas I had in stock. Here, let me mark it on your map.	
FormID: 0001DB20	MS23	MS23RalsaGreet2	0	Thank you. I'm sure he'll be pleased. I must go now. Good day to you.	
FormID: 0001DB1F	MS23	MS23RalsaGreet	0	Thank you. Gilen always tends to exaggerate, but in this case he sounded earnest which worries me a bit...	
FormID: 0001DB1F	MS23	MS23RalsaGreet	1	He said to tell you that the matter he needs help with is of the utmost importance to the citizens of the Imperial City.	
FormID: 0001DB1F	MS23	MS23RalsaGreet	2	You're to meet him at Seridur's house which is located in the Temple District. He said all will be explained when you get there.	
FormID: 0001DB1F	MS23	MS23RalsaGreet	3	That's all he told me to say.	
FormID: 00025B37	MS38	ToutiusSextiusTopic	0	Thanks to you, his sinister plans have now been revealed to me.	
FormID: 00025B38	MS38	ToutiusSextiusTopic	0	I was sure he was part of the conspiracy. Sure of it. I guess it just goes to show ... well, we'll see what it goes to show, won't we?	
FormID: 0001DC47	NQDSkingrad	ToutiusSextiusTopic	0	He lives in the large house between the Low Gate and the East Bridge. Alone -- suspicious, don't you think?	
FormID: 00023669	MS38	MS38Next	0	Toutius Sextius, do you know him? A quiet fellow, appears harmless enough, but I've identified him as one of my key suspects.	
FormID: 00023669	MS38	MS38Next	1	He's a clever one, no doubt about it. Eyes in the back of his head, always seems to know when I'm watching.  But that's where you come in.	
FormID: 00023669	MS38	MS38Next	2	You should wait outside his house and see what he does when he's not watching me. I'll meet you here tomorrow night to get your report.	
FormID: 0001DC33	MS38	MS38Next	0	Do you know Davide Surilie? Yes, of the famous Surilie Vineyards. Pillar of the community, et cetera. Who would ever suspect him?	
FormID: 0001DC33	MS38	MS38Next	1	Perfect cover for the ringleader of the whole conspiracy! He watches my house constantly. You'll see.	
FormID: 0001DC33	MS38	MS38Next	2	He leaves his house early each morning. Watch him and report back to me here, at midnight as usual. Make sure he doesn't notice you!	
FormID: 0001DC32	MS38	MS38Reward	0	Ah, of course. The gold. Here. But there is someone else I need you to investigate.	
FormID: 00023664	MS38	MS38Reward	0	Yes, the gold that you value so highly. I wonder, what price betrayal ... never mind that. We shall see ... I do have one more name for you.	Middle two sentences almost talking to himself (he wonders if the player is betraying him)
FormID: 00023665	MS38	MS38Reward	0	Here you go, my friend. Trust me, you've earned it. There is one last person that needs looking into, though.	
FormID: 00023666	MS38	MS38Reward	0	Yes, of course, here is your precious gold. Now I need you to investigate one more person for me.	
FormID: 0002585C	MS38	MS38Reward	0	Here's the gold, as promised. I always pay my debts, and then some. Do the last .. task ... in that note, and I will pay you much, much more.	
FormID: 00023668	MS38	MS38Reward	0	You certainly earned this. Take it with my thanks. I believe it must have been fate that brought the two of us together. Goodbye.	
FormID: 0002367A	MS38	MS38Reward	0	By all means. I would have paid any amount to be rid of those watching eyes, always watching me ... but never again! Ha ha ha! I'm FREE!!	more manic giddiness
FormID: 00023670	MS38	MS38DSNo	0	Just as I suspected!! They've gotten to you too! Not one of them involved in the conspiracy, and you expect me to believe that?!	frothing at the mouth
FormID: 00023670	MS38	MS38DSNo	1	Now I know for sure that they are all in on it. And therefore they all have to die. Starting with you!!	
FormID: 00023671	MS38	MS38DSNo	0	Well then... I suppose I must believe you. At least now I can be sure... [Scribbles something on a piece of paper.] Here. This is your last task.	
FormID: 000BE418	MS38	MS38DSNo	0	That is a relief... I was sure... but you have proved yourself... trustworthy. A friend indeed!	surprise, but jubilant (you've killed at least one other of his victims already)
FormID: 0002366F	MS38	MS38DSYes	0	And so it all falls into place... yes, yes, it all makes sense now. [Scribbles something on a piece of paper.] Here. This is your last task.	
FormID: 0002366A	MS38	MS38TSNo	0	So he really is innocent, then. Interesting ... perhaps they have been using him as a decoy, to draw my attention away from their real spies ...	
FormID: 0002366B	MS38	MS38TSNo	0	Really?! So you're saying that neither Bernadette Peneles or Toutius Sextius is part of the conspiracy against me? Hard to believe.	
FormID: 0002366E	MS38	MS38TSYes	0	So I was right all along! You're doing excellent work, my friend.	
FormID: 0001DC2F	MS38	MS38NotYet	0	Then why do you waste my time!?  Do as you agreed, and meet me here tomorrow night!	
FormID: 0001DC30	MS38	MS38BPNo	0	Really? That is surprising. I was SURE she was watching me.	
FormID: 0001DC31	MS38	MS38BPYes	0	Just as I thought, just as I thought. Excellent work. There will be a bonus in this for you, don't worry.	
FormID: 0001DC2E	MS38	MS38Decline	0	Oh, well... I, I understand. The danger is too great. You're right, you should stay out of this. I'll just have to solve this myself.	
FormID: 0001DC2D	MS38	MS38Agree	0	Very good, you won't be sorry.  I'll pay you well, did I say that already?	
FormID: 0001DC2D	MS38	MS38Agree	1	Let's start with Bernadette Peneles.  Be outside my house at 6 am, you'll see her watching me.  See where she goes and who she reports to.	
FormID: 0001DC2D	MS38	MS38Agree	2	We'll meet here again tomorrow night.  Oh, and NEVER contact me in public.  They're watching.  They can't know you're helping me.	
FormID: 0001DCC5	MS38	MS38DionneWarnChoice3	0	Let me give you some advice. Glarthir is crazy. So far harmless crazy, but I keep an eye on him because it's my job to.	
FormID: 0001DCC5	MS38	MS38DionneWarnChoice3	1	You don't want to get involved with him. I don't care how much he's paying you, it isn't worth it. Like I said, he's crazy.	
FormID: 0001DCC5	MS38	MS38DionneWarnChoice3	2	Since you were courteous enough to tell me the truth, I'll do the same by trusting you to talk to a guard if he asks you to do anything... strange.	
FormID: 0001DCC3	MS38	MS38DionneWarnChoice2	0	Fine. Play it that way. Let me give you some friendly advice. Glarthir is crazy. Maybe harmless crazy, maybe not.	
FormID: 0001DCC3	MS38	MS38DionneWarnChoice2	1	Don't get involved with him. If he asks you to do anything... strange... you come see me first, got it? Or any of the town Guard. Let us handle it.	
FormID: 0001DCC2	MS38	MS38DionneWarnChoice1	0	It is my business.  Allow me to introduce myself: Captain Dion of the Count's Guard, at your service.	REC: emphasis on IS -- [QUOTE]It IS my business[QUOTE] (replying to player [QUOTE]None of your business[QUOTE]). Sarcastic introduction -- you're talking to a cop, bonehead.

FormID: 0002587B	MS38	BernadettePenelesTopic	0	I always suspected she was watching me. Thank you for finally confirming it.	
FormID: 00025887	MS38	BernadettePenelesTopic	0	I still can hardly believe she wasn't watching me. But it is a relief to be able to finally stop worrying about her.	
FormID: 0001DCBA	NQDSkingrad	BernadettePenelesTopic	0	Her house is almost directly across the street from mine, southwest of the Great Chapel. Coincidence? I don't think so.	
FormID: 000251F5	Dark00General	Sanctuary	0	Ours is not the only Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary. There are others, hidden throughout Cyrodiil, each one overseen by a Speaker of the Black Hand.  	
FormID: 000251F6	Dark00General	Sanctuary	0	This Sanctuary has been here since before even I joined the Dark Brotherhood, and that was two-hundred years ago.

FormID: 000251F9	Dark00General	Sanctuary	0	In truth, I miss the towering elms of my native Valenwood. But I was banished from there, for deeds I don't care to discuss. This is my home now.

FormID: 0001E74F	MQ02	MQ02JauffreD4	0	I'm not sure. Only the Emperors truly understand the meaning behind the rituals of coronation.	
FormID: 0001E74F	MQ02	MQ02JauffreD4	1	The Amulet of Kings is ancient. Saint Alessia herself received it from the gods. It is a holy relic of great power.	
FormID: 0001E74F	MQ02	MQ02JauffreD4	2	When an Emperor is crowned, he uses the Amulet to light the Dragonfires at the Temple of the One in the Imperial City.	
FormID: 0001E74F	MQ02	MQ02JauffreD4	3	With the Emperor dead and no new heir crowned, the Dragonfires in the Temple will be dark, for the first time in centuries.	
FormID: 0001E74F	MQ02	MQ02JauffreD4	4	It may be that the Dragonfires protected us from a threat that only the Emperor was aware of.	
FormID: 0001E74D	MQ02	MQ02JauffreE1	0	His name is Martin. He is a priest in the Chapel of Akatosh in Kvatch. Yes, Kvatch.	
FormID: 0001E74D	MQ02	MQ02JauffreE1	1	I cannot believe that the attack on Kvatch is a coincidence. The enemy seem to know all our secrets.	
FormID: 0001E74D	MQ02	MQ02JauffreE1	2	You must return to Kvatch at once, and rescue Martin if he lives. There is no time to lose!	
FormID: 0001E74D	MQ02	MQ02JauffreE1	3	If there's anything you need, please ask. My resources here are limited, but I will help in any way I can.	
FormID: 0001E74E	MQ02	MQ02JauffreE1	0	His name is Martin. He serves Akatosh in the Chapel in the city of Kvatch, south of here.	
FormID: 0001E74E	MQ02	MQ02JauffreE1	1	You must go to Kvatch and find him at once. If the enemy is aware of his existence, as seems likely, he is in terrible danger.	
FormID: 0001E74E	MQ02	MQ02JauffreE1	2	And please, let me know if there's anything you need. My resources here are limited, but I will help in any way I can.	
FormID: 0001E74C	MQ02	MQ02JauffreD3	0	I am one of the few who know of his existence. Many years ago, I served as captain of Uriel's bodyguards, the Blades.	
FormID: 0001E74C	MQ02	MQ02JauffreD3	1	One night Uriel called me in to his private chambers. A baby boy lay sleeping in a basket. Uriel told me to deliver him somewhere safe.	
FormID: 0001E74C	MQ02	MQ02JauffreD3	2	He never told me anything else about the baby, but I knew it was his son. From time to time he would ask about the child's progress.	
FormID: 0001E74C	MQ02	MQ02JauffreD3	3	Now, it seems that this illegitimate son is the heir to the Septim Throne. If he yet lives.

FormID: 0001EC28	SE08	SE08PlaceGuardsEnd	0	Very well, Your Grace.	Soldier accepting an order.
FormID: 0001EE2E	MQ04	MQ04KeepMartinSafe	0	Nowhere is truly safe against the power arrayed against us. But we must play for time, at least...	
FormID: 0001EE2E	MQ04	MQ04KeepMartinSafe	1	Cloud Ruler Temple, I think. The hidden fortress of the Blades, in the mountains near Bruma. A few men can hold it against an army.	
FormID: 0001EE2E	MQ04	MQ04KeepMartinSafe	2	We should leave at once.	
FormID: 0001EE2D	MQ04	MQ04FoundMartin	0	So it has not all gone against us. Thank Talos for that! We gained Uriel's heir, and lost the Amulet of Kings.	
FormID: 0001EE2D	MQ04	MQ04FoundMartin	1	Martin cannot stay here. We have driven them off, but they will be back once they learn of Martin's survival. Which they will.	
FormID: 0001EE2C	MQ04	MQ04AmuletGone	0	I should have known they could find it. Little can remain hid from a Daedra Lord. I underestimated the enemy. It will not happen again.	
FormID: 0001EE2C	MQ04	MQ04AmuletGone	1	What of your mission to Kvatch?	
FormID: 0001EE2B	MQ04	MQ04CheckOnAmulet	0	We'll go together. But I fear the worst.	
FormID: 0001EE2A	MQ04	MQ04WheresJauffre	0	I don't know. In the Chapel praying, I think. You must help us!	
FormID: 0001EE29	MQ04	MQ04SlowDown	0	I don't know! I think they're right behind me! Prior Maborel is dead!	
FormID: 0001EE28	MQ04	MQ04WeynonAttack	0	I was in the sheepfold when they attacked. I heard the Prior talking to someone. 	breathlessly ... he's just been running for his life
FormID: 0001EE28	MQ04	MQ04WeynonAttack	1	Looked around the corner to see who it was. They looked like travellers, ordinary. 	
FormID: 0001EE28	MQ04	MQ04WeynonAttack	2	Suddenly weapons appeared in their hands and they cut the Prior down before he could move! They saw me watching and I ran.	
FormID: 00026AC3	DANocturnal	DANocturnalChoice2	0	Then leave, and forget you have ever seen this place.	
FormID: 00026AC1	DANocturnal	DANocturnalChoice1	0	Perhaps you have been summoned. Perhaps Nocturnal desires your service, and has guided you here. Approach.	
FormID: 00026ABF	DANocturnal	WeebumNaTOPIC	0	I am Weebam-Na. What do you want?	
FormID: 00026AC5	DANocturnal	WeebumNaTOPIC	0	He's always got some scam going with Bejeen, his partner. You might find them both at Weebum-Na's house.	
FormID: 00026ABE	DANocturnal	BejeenTOPIC	0	Yes? I am Bejeen.	
FormID: 00026AC6	DANocturnal	BejeenTOPIC	0	She wasn't a bad sort until she hooked up with that rascal Weebam-Na. That's where you're likely to find her... at Weebam-Na's house.	
FormID: 00026AB5	DANocturnal	EyeofNocturnalTOPIC	0	Eye of Nocturnal? Doesn't sound familiar to me.	
FormID: 00026AC0	DANocturnal	EyeofNocturnalTOPIC	0	Why... why would you ask? I've never heard of it. No idea what you're talking about. And Weebam-Na doesn't know, either.	
FormID: 00026AC7	DANocturnal	EyeofNocturnalTOPIC	0	Never heard of the thing. And neither has Bejeen. You ask too many questions.	
FormID: 000B97C0	DANocturnal	ShrineofNocturnalTOPIC	0	You have been given a task. Do it.	
FormID: 000B97C4	DANocturnal	ShrineofNocturnalTOPIC	0	Approach the shrine, if you dare.	
FormID: 00026AC2	DANocturnal	ShrineofNocturnalTOPIC	0	You should not be in this place. What is your business here? Do you believe yourself worthy to speak to Nocturnal?	
FormID: 0001EFE2	MQ04	MQ04MartinEmperor	0	The Emperor... that's an idea that will take some getting used to.	bemused
FormID: 0001EFE2	MQ04	MQ04MartinEmperor	1	In any case, we need the Amulet first. Maybe Jauffre will know where to start.	
FormID: 0001EFE1	MQ04	MQ04MartinGetAmulet	0	Of course. The Amulet of Kings. So we... I... can take it to the Temple of the One and light the Dragonfires. And stop the Oblivion invasion.	
FormID: 0001F10B	MQ06	MQ05ShrinePassword	0	Welcome, brother. The hour is late, but the Master still has need for willing hands. 	
FormID: 0001F10B	MQ06	MQ05ShrinePassword	1	You may pass into the Shrine. Harrow will take you to the Master for your initiation into the service of Lord Dagon.	
FormID: 0001F10B	MQ06	MQ05ShrinePassword	2	Do not tarry. The time of Preparation is almost over. The time of Cleansing is near.	
FormID: 0001F874	MQ06	MQ05ShrinePassword	0	Welcome, sister. The hour is late, but the Master still has need for willing hands. 	
FormID: 0001F874	MQ06	MQ05ShrinePassword	1	You may pass into the Shrine. Harrow will take you to the Master for your initiation into the service of Lord Dagon.	
FormID: 0001F874	MQ06	MQ05ShrinePassword	2	Do not tarry. The time of Preparation is almost over. The time of Cleansing is near.	
FormID: 0001F16A	MQ06	MQ06NoGiveFinal	0	Then you have come here to die.	
FormID: 0001F169	MQ06	MQ06NoGive	0	What? I must warn you, no one leaves this place who does not bind himself to the service of Lord Dagon.	
FormID: 0001F169	MQ06	MQ06NoGive	1	But I am sure you will reconsider. You have proven yourself worthy and dedicated to have come this far.	
FormID: 0001F169	MQ06	MQ06NoGive	2	I ask you one last time: give me your possessions. The Master requires it of all initiates.	
FormID: 0001F168	MQ06	MQ06GivePossessions	0	Very good. Follow me. I will take you to the Shrine.	
FormID: 0001F3BA	SE07	SE07Arden	0	Blasphemy! Never utter the name of the Dark Deceiver lightly!	
FormID: 0001F3BA	SE07	SE07Arden	1	Though his body is beyond Oblivion, his soul encircles us... always watching, waiting to pounce with lethal aplomb.	
FormID: 0001F3BA	SE07	SE07Arden	2	He is the bringer of pain and pleasure; the blade that cuts through our sins like a scythe through wheat.	
FormID: 0001F3BA	SE07	SE07Arden	3	Only a true Demented can appreciate what it means to render his name.	
FormID: 0001F3BB	SE07	SE07Arden	0	Yes, Arden-Sul. Doesn't the name simply roll wonderfully off the tongue?	
FormID: 0001F3BB	SE07	SE07Arden	1	He was the sovereign of thought and a regnant artist. To call him a simple craftsman would not suffice; know him as the Artificer Superior.	
FormID: 0001F3BB	SE07	SE07Arden	2	Words dripped like honey from his tongue and his songs were intoned with extraordinary verisimilitude.	
FormID: 0001F3BB	SE07	SE07Arden	3	Had we been blessed with his constant presence, the Isles would be a Maniac's paradise.	
FormID: 0001F3ED	SE30	SE30ForgeMadnessAxeMagic	0	Think of me fondly when you bury this axe deep into your foe's skull.	A creepy, slow, sensual drawl. Emphasizing words dealing with blood and gore as if she were talking about making love.
FormID: 0001F3EC	SE30	SE30ForgeMadnessAxe	0	When you hack off an arm, the blood spurts out in surges.	A creepy, slow, sensual drawl. Emphasizing words dealing with blood and gore as if she were talking about making love.

FormID: 0001F3DF	SE30	SE30ForgeMadnessClaymoreM	0	When you are really angry, it feels good to hack into someone with a giant blade.	A creepy, slow, sensual drawl. Emphasizing words dealing with blood and gore as if she were talking about making love.
FormID: 0001F3DD	SE30	SE30ForgeMadnessClaymore	0	With enough force, this will cleave through meat and bone. 	A creepy, slow, sensual drawl. Emphasizing words dealing with blood and gore as if she were talking about making love.
FormID: 0001F3C8	SE30	SE30ForgeNevermind	0	As you wish.	
FormID: 000819AB	SE30	SE30ForgeNevermind	0	Maybe later.	
FormID: 0001F431	MS08	AxeofDragol	0	Yeah. It's a battleaxe with the word [QUOTE]Dragol[QUOTE] carved into the haft. Huge. You can't miss it. I ain't gonna draw you a picture.	
FormID: 0001FDB1	MS08	AxeofDragol	0	Aleron never mentioned it to me before.	
FormID: 0001FDB5	MS08	AxeofDragol	0	Clever ruse. I wonder how many have died falling for it?	
FormID: 0001FDBA	MS08	AxeofDragol	0	You haven't guessed it yet? There never was any Axe of Dragol. It was just a ruse to lure you out here.	
FormID: 0001FDBA	MS08	AxeofDragol	1	I fell for the same trick. In my case, he told me if I retrieved the axe, he'd erase my debts. I was such an idiot to believe him.	
FormID: 0001FDBA	MS08	AxeofDragol	2	You're now the prey in Kurdan's insane hunt, just like I am. And here, we'll most likely die.	
FormID: 0001F42F	MS08	MS08KurdanBoatNo	0	Fine. But you better not take too long. I want that axe, and I want it now.	
FormID: 0001F430	MS08	MS08KurdanBoatYes	0	Fine. I have it waitin' for you at the dock next to the magic shop. Now get outta my sight.	
FormID: 0001F42E	MS08	MS08KurdanIfIDont	0	Then Aleron may not be coming home from his... ahhh, journey, for a very long time. Like permanently.	
FormID: 0001F42E	MS08	MS08KurdanIfIDont	1	Whenever yer ready, and it better be soon, I'll have a boat waitin' for you to get to Fort Grief Island.	
FormID: 0001F42D	MS08	MS08KurdanJar	0	I just learned that a family heirloom, the Axe of Dragol, which one of my stupid relatives lost, is located on Fort Grief Island in Niben Bay.	
FormID: 0001F42D	MS08	MS08KurdanJar	1	My informant tells me it's hidden in the main keep at the center. Dunno what's guardin' it, but I'm sure you can handle it.	
FormID: 0001F42D	MS08	MS08KurdanJar	2	If you go there and bring it back to me, I'll tell you exactly where Aleron is.	
FormID: 0001F42C	MS08	MS08UrsanneNoWorry	0	You... you will? Oh thank you! Please be careful, I don't wish any harm to befall you either.	
FormID: 0001F42B	MS08	MS08UrsanneTell	0	Yesterday, the usurer, Kurdan gro-Dragol, sent for my husband to meet him at the Lonely Suitor Lodge. He hasn't returned since.	
FormID: 0001F42B	MS08	MS08UrsanneTell	1	I fear for his life. Kurdan isn't known for his patience. Please, I'm not wealthy, but I'd give anything to see Aleron again.	
FormID: 0001F422	MS08	AleronLocheTopic	0	Time's wastin'. He's safe... for now.	
FormID: 0001F423	MS08	AleronLocheTopic	0	Maybe I know him, maybe I don't. But since yer so interested, I know somethin' that could jar my memory.	
FormID: 0001F424	MS08	AleronLocheTopic	0	None of yer damn business. I'd tell you if I liked you... and I don't.	
FormID: 0001FDB8	MS08	AleronLocheTopic	0	I knew it! I just knew he's gotten himself in hot water again. Please hurry and get him from that island.	
FormID: 0001F425	MS08	AleronLocheTopic	0	I do miss him so. And when he gets back, I'm gonna kill him for making me worry like this!	
FormID: 0001F42A	MS08	AleronLocheTopic	0	It all started when Aleron became foolish, and started gambling. He'd visit the arena every week and spend our hard earned money on bets.	
FormID: 0001F42A	MS08	AleronLocheTopic	1	I told him to stop, but he didn't listen. He was certain he could win us a fortune and move us somewhere nicer, like the Imperial City.	
FormID: 0001F42A	MS08	AleronLocheTopic	2	It didn't take long for Aleron to begin losing. He resorted to borrowing money from a usurer to cover his losses and place new bets.	
FormID: 0001F42A	MS08	AleronLocheTopic	3	As you can imagine, it didn't pay off. He ended up owing around 500 gold. We could never have that kind of money to pay back the usurer.	
FormID: 00071321	MS08	AleronLocheTopic	0	Yeah, Ursanne's husband, Aleron is missing. Poor thing, I've seen her crying at the chapel. I hope someone can help her.	REC

FormID: 0001FB72	TG11Heist	TG11P5HowIsThat	0	I arranged for the notable Celia Camoran to want to read a particular Elder Scroll. Don't ask how. However, she will be... unavoidably detained.	
FormID: 0001FB72	TG11Heist	TG11P5HowIsThat	1	You will take her place. Do not speak to the priests. They are blindfolded and will not realize it isn't her unless you speak.

FormID: 0018D2A4	MQ00	BrumaTopic	0	The Countess sent Captain Burd to deal with that Oblivion Gate outside of town. We're all praying that they'll be all right.	
FormID: 0018D2A5	MQ00	BrumaTopic	0	If Captain Burd and the Guard can't close that Oblivion Gate, then what? Will Bruma be destroyed just like Kvatch?	
FormID: 0003C978	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	Sorry. All I have is paints. Serviceable beasts, but nothing special. We Nords are no great fanciers of horse flesh, except in stews, I'm afraid.	
FormID: 0003C97C	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	I'm new here in Bruma myself. I'm from down Heartland way. Nords up here... no offense... don't work as hard as us Imperial Heartlanders.	
FormID: 0003C97E	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	The Countess is Heartland Nibenean, and so are most guildsmen and chapelmen, but most others are as Nordish as you'll find.	
FormID: 0003C97F	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	Lyra Rosentia collects Akaviri artifacts. She might have a project in mind. Her house is west of the chapel.	
FormID: 0003C985	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	Nords who drink either get friendly or mean. I'm here to deal with the mean ones.	
FormID: 0003C987	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	We're still in Cyrodiil here in Bruma, but just barely. We build for the cold, just like in Skyrim.	
FormID: 0003C989	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	No need to go to the Imperial City. Bruma may look like a Skyrim town, but we've got all the comforts of the warm Nibenean south.	
FormID: 0003C98B	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	We drink because we're happy. We're Nords. It's just the thick tongue and fat head the day after that makes me unhappy.	
FormID: 0003C98D	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	Just like Skyrim, except for all the tight-ass Heartlanders around. All work and chapel... no wonder they're so sour.	
FormID: 0003C98F	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	I work hard. Folks like Skjorta and Olfand give us Nords a bad name, drinking and carrying on until all hours.	
FormID: 0003C991	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	We're trying to bring the comfort of the Chapel to the Nords here, but Bruma's Nords stick to their heathen gods and uncivilized practices.	
FormID: 0003C993	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	The Chapel has made enemies here in the past. The Nords prefer their dragon Ysmir to our Father Akatosh.	
FormID: 0003C995	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	I'm here to show Bruma's errant Nords the path to the true faith. They must put aside their heathen gods and worship the Nine.	
FormID: 0003C997	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	Some see only the conflicts between northern and southern cultures, but I see the way they are stronger when woven together.	
FormID: 0003C999	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	Captain Burd and I make a good pair. He understands Nords and the North, while I appreciate the subtleties of southern culture and politics.	
FormID: 0003C99B	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	I make sure my guards treat the local Nords and their ways with respect.	
FormID: 0003C99D	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	As Captain Burd says, we have to stay on the good side of the local Nords. It ain't their fault they're ignorant barbarians.	
FormID: 0003C99F	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	This is my first posting after Arcane University. The Countess and Burd like my work well enough.	
FormID: 0003C9A2	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	You get used to the cold. Got a good set of fur boots to keep my feet warm. Give a Nord a good thumping to keep the blood flowing, khah-khah-khah.	
FormID: 0003C9A3	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	Yeah, you think Bruma's cold, try a winter in the Wrothgarians. Bruma's a day at the beach.	
FormID: 0003C9A5	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	You know what it's like. Make lots of friends, and look busy. Same as anywhere.	
FormID: 0003C9A7	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	It's a little too rugged up here for me. Add a couple hairs to a Nord and you've got a bear.	
FormID: 0003C9A9	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	Well, sometimes I feel we're not welcome here. The Nords don't like Heartlanders very much.	
FormID: 0003C9AB	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	Plenty of mineral desposits in the Jerall Mountains. I'm out for weeks at a time by myself, but I don't mind it.	
FormID: 0003C9AD	NQDBruma	BrumaTopic	0	Bruma's a funny place... half Cyrodiil and half Skyrim. I'm old Nord all the way. I keep the old songs and stories alive.

FormID: 00020093	MQ07	MQ07BeggarPay	2	Now, if you'll excuse me, all this talk has given me a powerful thirst. Thankee kindly.	
FormID: 000221F8	MQ07	JearlTopic	0	She's just back from a trip south, they say. Haven't seen hide nor hair of her myself though. Stays indoors all day long, I guess.	
FormID: 00020071	MQ07	MQ07Strangers	0	Not that it's anybody's business, but I have noticed voices coming from Jearl's house. But I've never seen anybody but Jearl go in or out. Strange.	
FormID: 00020072	MQ07	MQ07Strangers	0	Well, since I like you ... I think there's somebody staying with Jearl.	
FormID: 00020072	MQ07	MQ07Strangers	1	Never seen 'em, but I've heard her talking to someone, and I've seen somebody at the window when Jearl wasn't home.	
FormID: 00020072	MQ07	MQ07Strangers	2	None of my business, but since you asked ...	
FormID: 00020090	MQ07	MQ07Strangers	0	Nothing comes to mind. Of course, my memory sometimes ain't what it used to be.	
FormID: 00038BC5	MQ07	MQ07Strangers	0	Not on my watch. Captain Burd will know for sure, though. We all report to him.	
FormID: 00020091	MQ07	MQ07Strangers	0	Not that I can think of. People are mostly staying home, what with all the troubles in the world.	
FormID: 0002008F	MQ07	MQ07BurdA	0	Really? That is odd. I know for certain that she returned alone. I don't like it.	
FormID: 0002008F	MQ07	MQ07BurdA	1	Since you're working with Cloud Ruler Temple, I'm going to authorize you to search Jearl's house. I'll pass the word to my men. We won't interfere.	
FormID: 00020081	MQ07	MQ07ProgressAllDead	0	Excellent work. I knew I could count on you. The gods did not idly choose you as their agent, whatever you may think.	
FormID: 00020081	MQ07	MQ07ProgressAllDead	1	But we have not eliminated the threat against Bruma and Cloud Ruler Temple, only delayed it. I will warn the Countess of the danger.	
FormID: 00020081	MQ07	MQ07ProgressAllDead	2	You should speak to Martin. I believe he has made some progress with the Mysterium Xarxes.	
FormID: 00020084	MQ07	MQ07ProgressPlans	0	This makes for grim reading. The Mythic Dawn did not take long to locate Martin again.	
FormID: 00020084	MQ07	MQ07ProgressPlans	1	The document speaks of two agents. You need to eliminate both of them.	
FormID: 00020085	MQ07	MQ07ProgressPlans	0	Excellent work. I knew I could count on you. The gods did not idly choose you as their agent, whatever you may think.	
FormID: 00020085	MQ07	MQ07ProgressPlans	1	But it is clear that Mankar Camoran will soon bring all his power to bear against Bruma. I will warn the Countess of the danger.	
FormID: 00020085	MQ07	MQ07ProgressPlans	2	You should speak to Martin. I believe he has made some progress with the Mysterium Xarxes.	
FormID: 00020082	MQ07	MQ07ProgressDead	0	Good. But there may still be more spies out there. You should continue to search for their base of operations in Bruma.	
FormID: 00020083	MQ07	MQ07ProgressNone	0	Very well. Keep looking. We must uncover those spies and find out what they know.	
FormID: 00038FAD	MQ07	MQ07ProgressNone	0	You must eliminate both the Mythic Dawn agents in Bruma. We cannot allow them to continue to plot against us.	
FormID: 00020076	MQ07	MQ07SpiesResponse	0	Thank you. Talk to Steffan. He can tell you where he has seen them.	
FormID: 00020076	MQ07	MQ07SpiesResponse	1	Captain Burd in Bruma may also be able to help. I've asked the Countess to have the guard keep an eye out for strangers.	
FormID: 00020076	MQ07	MQ07SpiesResponse	2	Track down the spies and kill them. Find out what they know, and what they're plannning, if possible.	
FormID: 00020075	MQ07	MQ07Spies	0	Ah, yes. I hope you can help. The gate guards have reported seeing strangers on the road for the past several nights.	
FormID: 00020075	MQ07	MQ07Spies	1	I cannot leave Cloud Ruler undefended while my men search the whole mountainside, but these spies must be eliminated.	
FormID: 00020077	MQ07	MQ07Spies	0	We always see them near the runestone at dusk. They aren't too woodcrafty, but Grandmaster Jauffre has forbidden us to range too far from the walls.	REC
FormID: 00020077	MQ07	MQ07Spies	1	But it seems that you have been given the freedom to attack the enemy that we all crave! Good luck. We will keep the Emperor safe here, don't worry.	
FormID: 0002008D	MQ07	MQ07Spies	0	Except for Jearl coming back from a trip down south, things are pretty quiet. Not much travel right now with the Oblivion Crisis.	
FormID: 0002008D	MQ07	MQ07Spies	1	I've told my men to keep a sharp eye out, but I've had no reports of any strangers in town.	
FormID: 0002008D	MQ07	MQ07Spies	2	What about you? Turned up anything suspicious?	
FormID: 0002008E	MQ07	MQ07Spies	0	Nothing new to report on my end. Have you uncovered anything suspicious?	
FormID: 00039302	MQ07	MQ07Spies	0	I trust that you'll handle things ... appropriately. The less I know about it, the better.	
FormID: 00031622	SE07A	SE07ARuler	0	I do. I did. And I won't say it again. But, that's enough about that. You're the ruler of Dementia! Just look at you. You're positively beaming!	
FormID: 00031622	SE07A	SE07ARuler	1	You now have the power to summon Dark Seducers. They've always served the Duke of Dementia. I think they have a thing for pain.	
FormID: 00031622	SE07A	SE07ARuler	2	And here is the Ring of Lordship, a symbol of your new station. Symbols are important. They carry weight in this Realm, and others.	
FormID: 00031622	SE07A	SE07ARuler	3	You would be well served to remember that.	
FormID: 000206BB	SE07A	SE07AThadonLeaves	0	Enough! I go to Jyggalag. I give myself to him, as a Priest of Order! This isn't done, Madgod. I think it's just started.	
FormID: 000206BC	SE07A	SE07AThadonLeaves	0	No! Let him go!	As if to others in the room.
FormID: 000206BD	SE07A	SE07AThadonLeaves	0	Yes. That's it. I'll go. Away. Far away. Working for them is like working for us, but without all the dying.	
FormID: 000206BE	SE07A	SE07AThadonLeaves	0	Then go, Thadon. Have your Greenmote. Take a bath. But leave. Before I decorate my throne with your insides.	
FormID: 000206BF	SE07A	SE07AThadonLeaves	0	No. No. Certainly not. This isn't good. I'm sure it's bad. I can't do this anymore. No more. 	
FormID: 000206C0	SE07A	SE07AThadonLeaves	0	Change will preserve us! It is the lifeblood of the Isles. It will move mountains! It will mount movements!	
FormID: 000206C1	SE07A	SE07AThadonLeaves	0	Order approaches! It's taken the Fringe already! With Order clothes and Order hats! And you speak of [QUOTE]change[QUOTE]?	
FormID: 000206C2	SE07A	SE07AThadonLeaves	0	Fool? Visionary! Change is in the air, Thadon. Breathe it deep! Bathe in its scent! Bottle it up. Save some for later.	
FormID: 000206C3	SE07A	SE07AThadonLeaves	0	Ridiculous! You can't do this! Although... you're omnipotent. Or just tall. It's one of the two, I'm sure. And a fool!	
FormID: 000206C4	SE07A	SE07AThadonLeaves	0	Calm yourself, Thadon. You're making my teeth itch. You still hold your office. I suggest you see to your duties.	
FormID: 000206C5	SE07A	SE07AThadonLeaves	0	But, this... stranger? Someone new? From somewhere else? Not here. I'm sure of that. I don't understand. Or I can't.	accent [QUOTE]stranger[QUOTE] strongly
FormID: 000206CC	SE07A	SE07AThadonLeaves	0	Hold your tongue, little Duke, or I'll tear it from your mouth.	Furious
FormID: 000206CD	SE07A	SE07AThadonLeaves	0	Syl... my... Syl is dead? This can't be right. Is this right? What have you done? Have you done this?	
FormID: 00005676	Dark17Following	LucienLachanceTopic	0	When we confronted Lachance he tried to defend himself, tried to declare his innocence! But we would not hear his treacherous lies! 	
FormID: 00005676	Dark17Following	LucienLachanceTopic	1	As you can see, he was no match for the combined power of the Black Hand, even weakened as we are.	
FormID: 00005677	Dark17Following	LucienLachanceTopic	0	Most of my time is now spent on administrative duties. I have not had blood on my hands in far too long! Killing Lachance was pure ecstacy.	
FormID: 00005678	Dark17Following	LucienLachanceTopic	0	The four of us attacking him in unison was as graceful and beautiful as a ballet! The flashing of steel, the spraying of blood! 	REC -- flub -- should be [QUOTE]the four of us[QUOTE] not [QUOTE]the four of them[QUOTE]
FormID: 00005679	Dark17Following	LucienLachanceTopic	0	You should take some time to admire his corpse. It really is a thing of beauty. The punctures and slashes are almost... poetic.	
FormID: 00091219	Dark17Following	LucienLachanceTopic	0	I... I don't even know what to say. How could we have been so wrong? Lucien tried to explain, but we wouldn't listen...	
FormID: 00091219	Dark17Following	LucienLachanceTopic	1	But he is certainly in a better place now. Lucien Lachance's soul now serves Sithis in the Void. It is an honor he earned, and deserves.	
FormID: 000253D9	Dark00General	LucienLachanceTopic	0	Lucien isn't here very often. His duties with the Black Hand keep him very busy, so he trusts me to keep the Sanctuary in order.	
FormID: 000253DA	Dark00General	LucienLachanceTopic	0	When I first joined the family, this Sanctuary was controlled by another Speaker. Lucien took over when she was killed while fulfilling a contract.	
FormID: 000253DB	Dark00General	LucienLachanceTopic	0	I will always think of Lucien Lachance as my savior. When he found me, I was living in a gutter, an inch away from death. I owe him everything.	
FormID: 000253DC	Dark00General	LucienLachanceTopic	0	Ocheeva and I have known Lucien since we were hatchlings. He is the one who trained us in the way of the Shadowscale, and is like a father to us.	
FormID: 000253DD	Dark00General	LucienLachanceTopic	0	Actually, Lucien did not try to recruit me. Not at first. He tried to kill me. My father wanted me dead, and he hired the Dark Brotherhood to do it.	
FormID: 000253DD	Dark00General	LucienLachanceTopic	1	I escaped from Lucien, and paid my father back for his treachery. Lucien came to me again that night with an offer I just couldn't refuse. 	
FormID: 000253DE	Dark00General	LucienLachanceTopic	0	I once saw Lucien deal with an insubordinate Brother, someone who had broken the Tenets. It took me a week to get the blood off my boots.	
FormID: 000253D8	Dark05Assassinated	specialarrangement	0	The Dark Brotherhood is not in the business of staging deaths, no matter how much gold is offered. Sithis demands blood, and blood must be paid.	
FormID: 000253D8	Dark05Assassinated	specialarrangement	1	In order to accept the contract, we demanded a life. Motierre offered his mother, and we accepted. Lucien has already taken care of that... detail.	
FormID: 0001E85A	MG05A	MG05Choice2B	0	I suggest you deliver that book as soon as possible. Your recommendation depends on it.	
FormID: 00028C0A	MG05A	MG05Choice2B	0	Then why are we speaking? We have nothing to discuss unless you bring me that book. Now go away.	
FormID: 000224E6	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice2B	0	Then why are we speaking? We have nothing to discuss unless you bring me that book. Now go away.	
FormID: 000277A9	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice2B	0	No? Are you quite sure? I would hate to think that you do, in fact, have the book, and simply have no intention of turning it over.	
FormID: 000277A9	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice2B	1	Very well. Should you happen to find it, it would be in the best interest of all for it to be secure here within the guild hall.	
FormID: 000277AA	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice2B	0	I see. Perhaps it's just as well. The book is best left in secret.	
FormID: 000277AA	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice2B	1	If you were to know of its whereabouts, I trust that you would bring it to me immediately.	
FormID: 0001E852	MG05A	MG05Choice2A	0	Finally. I shall see to it that the book is kept safe until the Council decides what should be done with it. 	
FormID: 0001E852	MG05A	MG05Choice2A	1	I shall also overlook your... transgression, and send a recommendation to the Arcane University.	
FormID: 0001E853	MG05A	MG05Choice2A	0	Is this an attempt at humor? If so, I am not amused. Produce that book immediately.	
FormID: 00028C03	MG05A	MG05Choice2A	0	Ah, wonderful! I'll just take this from you, and get to work translating it. I'll need some time with this; come and find me tomorrow.	
FormID: 00028C03	MG05A	MG05Choice2A	1	I'll be here until I've finished my work. But please don't disturb me until I'm done; this is quite a delicate business, you see.	
FormID: 000224BA	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice2A	0	Ah, wonderful! I'll just take this from you, and get to work translating it. I'll need some time with this; come and find me tomorrow.	
FormID: 000224BA	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice2A	1	I'll be at the Grey Mare until I've finished my work. But please don't disturb me until I'm done; this is quite a delicate business, you see.	
FormID: 000224E7	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice2A	0	Either you're lying to me, or your feeble little mind has forgotten that you put it down someplace. I'm not amused. Go get the book.	
FormID: 00023FF2	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice2A	0	Ah, yes. This is indeed the correct book. You've not been able to open it, I presume? Then all is well.	
FormID: 00023FF2	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice2A	1	You have shown yourself worthy of the guild, and for that I thank you. You shall have the recommendation you need.	
FormID: 00023FF2	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice2A	2	Now, I must ensure this book is kept safe. Excuse me.	
FormID: 00023FF5	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice2A	0	Ah, yes. This is indeed the correct book. You've not been able to open it, I presume? Then all is well.	
FormID: 00023FF5	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice2A	1	You have helped ensure that this book will remain safe from those who would misuse it. You have the Guild's thanks. Now, if you'll excuse me...	
FormID: 000240C5	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice2A	0	This is not a matter for levity. If you have truly found the book, I expect you to bring it here once you have possession of it.	
FormID: 000224E3	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice1B	0	Hrmph. Very well. Good day.	
FormID: 0001E854	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice1A	0	Excellent. It's a simple task, really - all you need to do is fetch a book for me.	
FormID: 0001E854	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice1A	1	The book is entitled [QUOTE]Fingers of the Mountain[QUOTE] -- it is of no use to you; you won't be able to read it. I, however, can, and would very much like to.	typo
FormID: 0001E854	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice1A	2	You'll find it at an old ruin called Cloud Top. It's north of Chorrol, up in the mountains. I'm afraid I don't have an exact location.	
FormID: 0001E854	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice1A	3	Return it to me immediately when you have it. Make no mention of it to Teekeeus or anyone else in your guild. I will make it well worth your effort.	
FormID: 000224E4	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice1A	0	Excellent. It's a simple task, really - all you need to do is fetch a book for me.	
FormID: 000224E4	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice1A	1	The book is entitled [QUOTE]Fingers of the Mountain[QUOTE] -- it is of no use to you; you won't be able to read it. I, however, can, and would very much like to.

FormID: 000224E4	MG05Fingers	MG05Choice1A	3	Once you've got the book, return it to me immediately. I assure you, it will be worth your time.	
FormID: 0001E851	MG05A	FingersoftheMountain	0	Is the book safe? Do you have it?	
FormID: 0001E850	MG05A	FingersoftheMountain	0	Have you recovered the book yet?	
FormID: 00028BFF	MG05A	FingersoftheMountain	0	Curious that you should inquire about it, as it has recently gone missing. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?	
FormID: 00028C01	MG05A	FingersoftheMountain	0	I have the book stored safely for now; I shall hold on to it until the Council decides what should be done with it. 	
FormID: 00028C02	MG05A	FingersoftheMountain	0	The book is in safe hands for now; that is all you need to know.	
FormID: 00028C04	MG05A	FingersoftheMountain	0	Do you have it THIS time? Or did you decide to give it to another of my sworn enemies?	
FormID: 00028C08	MG05A	FingersoftheMountain	0	I believe I've made myself more than clear. I want that book, and I expect you to clean up this little mess you've made.	
FormID: 000285BF	MG05Fingers	FingersoftheMountain	0	The book is safe. That is all you need to know.	typo
FormID: 000285C0	MG05Fingers	FingersoftheMountain	0	Do you have the book this time?	
FormID: 000240C3	MG05Fingers	FingersoftheMountain	0	You've found the book? My trust in you was well-placed, it seems. Hand it over, if you please.	
FormID: 000240C4	MG05Fingers	FingersoftheMountain	0	Should you go looking for it, I hope that it would be for the sole purpose of bringing it here.	
FormID: 0002A68A	MG05Fingers	FingersoftheMountain	0	What? Not only does it exist, but she knows where it is? Well, this is unacceptable. That book needs to be in the safe-keeping of the Guild.	
FormID: 0002A68A	MG05Fingers	FingersoftheMountain	1	I trust that as a member of the Guild, you would do the right thing and acquire this text before Earana does.	
FormID: 0002A68A	MG05Fingers	FingersoftheMountain	2	Are we clear? Ignore her request, go to this place she has described, and return with the book. This is far more important than any petty squabble.	
FormID: 000236E5	MG05Fingers	FingersoftheMountain	0	So Earana has ascertained the location of the book, has she? This is an unfortunate turn of events. She can't be trusted with it.	
FormID: 000236E5	MG05Fingers	FingersoftheMountain	1	I would hope that any responsible citizen, if given the chance, would acquire the book and deliver it here, so that it may be properly looked after.	
FormID: 000236E5	MG05Fingers	FingersoftheMountain	2	That book requires a great deal of care and security. I hope I am making myself clear.	
FormID: 00022507	MG05Fingers	FingersoftheMountain	0	As I've said, the only notes I've taken, I have given to you. The rest is only of interest to me, I assure you.	
FormID: 00022507	MG05Fingers	FingersoftheMountain	1	Oh, and do be careful with what I've given you. It's very valuable, but... well, slightly dangerous. You'll see what I mean.	
FormID: 0002250A	MG05Fingers	FingersoftheMountain	0	I need more time to work on the translation. The more you bother me, the longer it's going to take.	
FormID: 000224E5	MG05Fingers	FingersoftheMountain	0	It's a very old text, written in a language I'm sure you wouldn't understand. Don't worry about it -- just bring me the book.	
FormID: 000253C6	MG05Fingers	FingersoftheMountain	0	If Teekeeus says it's a myth, I have no reason to believe otherwise. Can you prove him wrong?	
FormID: 000253C8	MG05Fingers	FingersoftheMountain	0	I've heard of it, but I don't really know what it is. Something about tapping into the power of the weather. Those Ayleids were pretty crazy.	
FormID: 000253CA	MG05Fingers	FingersoftheMountain	0	Well, look at that! You should take that to Teekeeus right away - he'll want to see it.	
FormID: 000253CC	MG05Fingers	FingersoftheMountain	0	I still don't believe it's real. If it was real, you'd have some sort of proof, right? Well, I don't see any proof.	
FormID: 000253D5	MG05Fingers	FingersoftheMountain	0	I've heard rumors, but they're nothing more than that. Imperials trying to harness the power of the Ayleids... they're not fools.	
FormID: 0002C309	MG05Fingers	FingersoftheMountain	0	Doesn't that have something to do with the Ayleids, and magical control over the weather? I think that's the rumor I heard.	
FormID: 0001E8AB	MS48	MS48Choice2C	0	That's a real shame. With just a little help, I think we would have a chance. But I can't risk leaving the camp defenseless.	
FormID: 00028031	MS48	MS48Choice2B	0	The longer we wait, the smaller our window of opportunity. Get ready, and do it quickly. We've got to move soon.	
FormID: 0001E8AC	MS48	MS48Choice2A	0	For Kvatch!	
FormID: 00008B87	MS48	MS48Choice1B	0	Then I suggest you head back to the safety of the encampment. I have no more time to talk.	
FormID: 0001E8AD	MS48	MS48Choice1B	0	That's what the Empire has come to. I doubt any of the other cities will be sending us aid either. Every man for himself these days.	bitterly
FormID: 00028030	MS48	MS48Choice1A	0	I don't know how to close this Gate, but it must be possible, because the enemy closed the ones they opened during the initial attack.	
FormID: 00028030	MS48	MS48Choice1A	1	You can see the marks on the ground where they were, with the Great Gate right in the middle.	
FormID: 00028030	MS48	MS48Choice1A	2	I sent men into the Gate, to see if they could find a way to shut it. They haven't come back.	
FormID: 00028030	MS48	MS48Choice1A	3	If you can get in there, find out what happened to them. If they're alive, help them finish the job. If not, see what you can do on your own.	
FormID: 00028030	MS48	MS48Choice1A	4	The best I can say is, good luck. If you make it back alive, we'll be waiting for you.	
FormID: 001778CD	MS48	SavlianMatiusTopic	0	You'll find him at the barricade at the top of the road. He's still trying to hold what's left of the Guard together.	
FormID: 000224AA	MS18	ValusOdiilTopic	0	We'll have to break the news to him that Antus didn't make it. He fought bravely, and father will respect that.	
FormID: 000B6C06	MS18	ValusOdiilTopic	0	I have the highest respect for my father... I just wish he could have seen us cross blades with the enemy.	
FormID: 000224AC	MS18	ValusOdiilTopic	0	He is not coming with us? I think I understand, and it is better that he remain safe. Though I wonder why he has asked you to take his place.	
FormID: 000224AC	MS18	ValusOdiilTopic	1	You would join us, though you have no personal stake in this fight? An honorable deed... I gladly accept your help, then.	
FormID: 000224AC	MS18	ValusOdiilTopic	2	There's no point in waiting here any longer. Follow me!	
FormID: 000224AE	MS18	ValusOdiilTopic	0	If my father is not at home, he should be in the Grey Mare. He is supposed to come with us.	
FormID: 000B6C10	MS18	ValusOdiilTopic	0	Father will be so proud of us... but I wish he'd been here.

FormID: 000224CD	MS18	ValusOdiilTopic	0	He's the best fighter you'll ever meet, and as soon as he gets here, we'll be off. Just wait; you'll see.	
FormID: 0002B8DF	MS18	Creatures	0	Aye, we've heard the old man's story. Nothing to back it up, though, except the word of those two kids of his. No real evidence.	
FormID: 0002B8DF	MS18	Creatures	1	Even if it was true, it's out in the forest somewhere. We need to keep what's inside the town walls safe, not go running around outside them.

FormID: 000224B4	MS18	Creatures	2	My boys will take up the fight even if the guards won't. Doesn't matter if it's outside the town walls - it still affects us all.	
FormID: 000224B4	MS18	Creatures	3	They expect me to go with them, but...  I fear in my old age, I'm not the warrior I once was. Would you... would you go in my place?

FormID: 000224C4	MS18	Creatures	0	I think I'm ready for this, but I worry about Antus. He's never seen a fight like this before.	
FormID: 000224CE	MS18	Creatures	0	They began raiding our farm a few days ago. There are more now, and I have no idea where they're coming from.	
FormID: 000224CE	MS18	Creatures	1	It's our duty to protect our own, even if others will do nothing. Father taught us that much, and we won't back down from a fight.	
FormID: 000224CE	MS18	Creatures	2	The guards claim there's no evidence of them, so they won't lift a finger. That's why we have to be the ones to deal with them.

FormID: 00023DD3	Dark00GeneralNPC	RufioTopic	1	His room is downstairs, in what I like to call the Private Quarters. Use that hatch in the floor over there. But don't expect a warm reception.	
FormID: 00023DD4	Dark00GeneralNPC	RufioTopic	0	Not a lot to tell. He doesn't much like company, and spends most of his time in his room. Manheim thinks he's hiding out from someone.

FormID: 00022E62	MS37	MS37JulienneTears	0	Certainly. Garridan was a knight who lorded over a small village of peaceful farmers. One harvest summer, there was a horrible drought.	
FormID: 00022E62	MS37	MS37JulienneTears	1	The farmers appealed to Garridan to discover a solution. He spent a week consulting with sages, until one of them mentioned a possibility.

FormID: 00022E60	MS37	GarridansTears	0	The Tears are not just a namesake. They're literally the frozen tears of a knight named Garridan Stalrous who lived many years ago.	
FormID: 00022E60	MS37	GarridansTears	1	I'm not certain what happened to the knight, or why the tears were frozen, but I do know someone you could ask.

FormID: 00022E5F	MS37	MS37SdrassaHelp	1	I want you to bring to me as many of Garridan's Tears as you can find. If you do, I will pay you a fair bounty in gold for each one.	
FormID: 00022E5F	MS37	MS37SdrassaHelp	2	I confess I have a weakness for crystals of a magical nature, and I must add these to my collection.	
FormID: 00022E5F	MS37	MS37SdrassaHelp	3	This is a personal errand, you must understand. Just between you and I. The Mages Guild has nothing to do with it.

FormID: 0008674F	Dark00General	NightMother	1	The statue, as you know, is located in the city of Bravil. You may speak with the Night Mother once a week, and then pass that information on to me.	
FormID: 0008674F	Dark00General	NightMother	2	Do that, and you will receive your share of this Sanctuary's weekly earnings.	
FormID: 00023683	MS38	MS38GuardWarnChoice1	0	Damn! He's finally gone completely bonkers! Thanks for the tip. Now stand aside and let the Guard do their work.	
FormID: 00023686	MS38	MS38GuardWarnChoice1	0	Julianos preserve us! I can't believe it ... why me?! Please, show this to the guards right away!	
FormID: 00023687	MS38	MS38GuardWarnChoice1	0	What?! This is ... unbelievable! Of all the strange fates, to become the target of a stranger's madness ...	
FormID: 00023687	MS38	MS38GuardWarnChoice1	1	Please, you must show this to the guards at once. My life is in your hands!	
FormID: 00023688	MS38	MS38GuardWarnChoice1	0	So he has finally snapped! I knew we should have warned the guards back when I noticed him trying to break into my house ...	
FormID: 00023688	MS38	MS38GuardWarnChoice1	1	This has gone far enough. It's past time I dealt with this madman once and for all.	
FormID: 00023682	MS38	MS38GuardChoice3	0	Why? What's he done?	
FormID: 00023681	MS38	MS38GuardChoice2	0	Really? He's getting worse, then. Thanks for letting me know. If you think he's becoming dangerous, you come straight to me and I'll handle it.	
FormID: 00023680	MS38	MS38GuardChoice1	0	Suit yourself.	
FormID: 00023685	MS38	MS38GuardChoice1	0	Very well.	
FormID: 000BE416	MS38	MS38DSDead	0	Dead, you say? Well, then... you may as well finish what you started. [Scribbles something on a piece of paper.] Here. This is your last task.	aghast but pleased at the same time
FormID: 0002367F	MS38	MS38DSDead	0	Dead, you say? ... you mean you ... did it really have to come to that? Well, if that was the only solution ... I suppose I should thank you.	aghast but pleased at the same time
FormID: 0002367E	MS38	MS38TSDead	0	Dead, you say? ... you mean you ... did it really have to come to that? Well, if that was the only solution ... I suppose I should thank you.	aghast but pleased at the same time
FormID: 0002367D	MS38	MS38BPDead	0	What? Dead?! ... you mean you... did it really have to come to that? Well, if that was the only solution... I suppose I should thank you.	aghast but pleased at the same time
FormID: 00023678	MS38	MS38DeadYes2	0	Really? She's really dead?! Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'm free, I'm finally FREE!	manic, over-the-edge giddiness

FormID: 00023676	MS38	MS38DeadNo	0	You won't help me? You're abandoning me now, just when I need you the most?!	crazed, rising to a frenzy
FormID: 00023676	MS38	MS38DeadNo	1	No... no. I understand. It is my problem, and I should solve it myself. You're right. I should never have involved you. Good night.	getting a grip on himself again

FormID: 00025888	MS38	DavideSurilieTopic	0	I knew he was the ringleader of the whole conspiracy! You may have helped save my life!	
FormID: 0002366C	NQDSkingrad	DavideSurilieTopic	0	The Surilie house is right next door to mine. A large house with a backyard conveniently located to observe my every move.	
FormID: 00034069	MQ04	CloudRulerTempleTopic	0	Cloud Ruler Temple was built long ago, by the founders of the Blades, back in the days of Reman Cyrodiil.	
FormID: 00034069	MQ04	CloudRulerTempleTopic	1	It is high in the mountains near Bruma... our ancient fortress, sanctuary, refuge of last resort. Martin will be as safe there as anywhere.	
FormID: 0003406A	MQ00	CloudRulerTempleTopic	0	This place was built by Reman Cyrodiil's Akaviri Dragonguard, at the founding of the Second Empire.	
FormID: 0003406A	MQ00	CloudRulerTempleTopic	1	Since then, it has served the Blades as a headquarters, fortress, and sanctuary. We can protect Martin here until you recover the Amulet of Kings.	
FormID: 000A31BB	MQ00	CloudRulerTempleTopic	0	This old place is the one thing that gives me some sense of certainty in these uncertain times.	
FormID: 0003406B	MQ00	CloudRulerTempleTopic	0	Don't worry, we'll keep the Emperor Martin safe here. No enemy has ever taken Cloud Ruler from the Blades.	
FormID: 000626C0	MQ00	CloudRulerTempleTopic	0	I'd have to say I'm partial to the Great Hall. On those cold nights, nothing warms your bones better than a roaring fire.	
FormID: 000626C1	MQ00	CloudRulerTempleTopic	0	There's no place more secure in all of Cyrodiil. I just wish... I wish we could have gotten our Lord Uriel here....	
FormID: 000626C2	MQ00	CloudRulerTempleTopic	0	Cloud Ruler is many things. Temple, fortress, safe haven. But it's also my home. I'll gladly die defending these walls, if it comes to it.	
FormID: 000626C3	MQ00	CloudRulerTempleTopic	0	Sometimes, when it's quiet, I walk the battlements and breathe in the cold mountain air. It's the only peace I allow myself.	
FormID: 000626C4	MQ00	CloudRulerTempleTopic	0	Aye, she's a beauty, isn't she? It's hard not to admire the stonework. That's some real craftsmanship, that is. 	REC
FormID: 0006BD49	MQ00	CloudRulerTempleTopic	0	I haven't been to Cloud Ruler since I was a young trainee. It feels good to be back. The Blades have always been here, and always will be.	
FormID: 000253D6	Dark04ExecutionFIN	Dark04FinChoice1B	0	As you wish. Just remember, had I issued a direct order, you would not have been able to refuse. So say the Tenets. Consider what I have said. 	
FormID: 000253D7	Dark04ExecutionFIN	Dark04FinChoice1A	0	You must go to the city of Chorrol and break into the house of Francois Motierre. Inside you will find Motierre waiting for you. Do not kill him! 	
FormID: 000253D7	Dark04ExecutionFIN	Dark04FinChoice1A	1	You see, Francois Motierre is a marked man. He owes a considerable sum to the wrong kind of people. So, they have sent an enforcer to kill him. 	
FormID: 000253D7	Dark04ExecutionFIN	Dark04FinChoice1A	2	Here. You will use this specially poisoned knife to stage Motierre's death, in the enforcer's presence. Motierre himself will provide more details.	 
FormID: 000253D7	Dark04ExecutionFIN	Dark04FinChoice1A	3	This is an unusual contract. Motierre had to make a special arrangement with us before it was approved. I trust in your professionalism.          	
FormID: 00023CD1	NQDChorrol	EmfridNot	0	Well, that's just my opinion.	
FormID: 00023CD0	NQDChorrol	EmfridHot	0	Emfrid? She owns the Grey Mare, right? Huh. I go to the Oak and Crosier. 	
FormID: 00023CD0	NQDChorrol	EmfridHot	1	I'm a captain, you see, and the Oak and Crosier serves... a better class of people...	
FormID: 00023CD0	NQDChorrol	EmfridHot	2	Listen to me. I sure sound like a snob. Snooty, in fact, and not very nice.	
FormID: 00023CD0	NQDChorrol	EmfridHot	3	Thanks. That's a very good suggestion. I think I'll stop by the Grey Mare, and perhaps pay my respects to this Emfrid woman.	
FormID: 0000C081	Dark07Medicine	contract	0	It's uncertain exactly what illness Roderick has contracted. But don't worry, it's probably not contagious. He he he he he.	
FormID: 0000C082	Dark07Medicine	contract	0	Actually, I gave you this contract in the hope that whatever Roderick has is contagious, and you'll die a slow, lingering death in a matter of days.	
FormID: 0000C083	Dark07Medicine	contract	0	Fort Sutch? I am familiar with that place. It is nestled deep in the mountains. It is naturally well defended, but there is a weakness.	
FormID: 0000C083	Dark07Medicine	contract	1	Not far from from the ruins of Fort Sutch lie the ruins of a tower. That tower was once part of the Fort Sutch Abbey. 	
FormID: 0000C083	Dark07Medicine	contract	2	The two ruins lie apart on the surface. But underground, they're connected by some now-flooded tunnels. Wet and dark, yes... but surely unguarded.	
FormID: 0000C084	Dark07Medicine	contract	0	Fort Sutch? It is an impregnable fortress surrounded by mountains. You'll never even get inside, let alone kill your target. Good luck.	
FormID: 0000C085	Dark07Medicine	contract	0	What do you mean nobody can see you? Where's the fun in that? Damn the bonus, I say! Just walk in there and stab him!	
FormID: 0000C086	Dark07Medicine	contract	0	Oh, this is going to be funny! You're going to be the first assassin in Dark Brotherhood history who couldn't even kill an invalid! Ha ha ha ha ha!	
FormID: 0000C0A2	Dark07Medicine	contract	0	Ah, now this is the type of contract I live for! You must become pure shadow. It's as if you were never there, and then Roderick simply... dies.	
FormID: 0000C0A3	Dark07Medicine	contract	0	This is an outrage! This contract should have gone to me! My stealth skills are unmatched! You will never succeed! Never!	
FormID: 0000C0A4	Dark07Medicine	contract	0	These mercenary groups tend to be fanatically loyal to whomever leader they follow. Roderick's people will likely fight to the death. Be cautious.   	
FormID: 0000C0A5	Dark07Medicine	contract	0	Roderick is a mercenary leader, and his people are fanatically loyal. They will cut you to ribbons if they see you. And they will see you.	
FormID: 0000C0A6	Dark07Medicine	contract	0	Ooh, using poision is so deliciously evil! I once poisioned my aunt's stew, and she fell over dead with her face right in the bowl! Ha ha ha ha ha!	
FormID: 0000C0A7	Dark07Medicine	contract	0	I think it says something about Ocheeva's faith in your abilities when she gives you a contract to kill someone who isn't even conscious...	
FormID: 00023C10	Dark05Assassinated	contract	0	The knife I gave you has been coated with a rare poison called Languorwine. You need only cut Motierre once, and he will appear to die.   	
FormID: 000253E1	Dark05Assassinated	contract	0	What a pathetic contract. Play acting and running, but no actual killing? I can see why Vicenti gave it to you... coward.	
FormID: 000253E2	Dark05Assassinated	contract	0	What? Fake a death? And you can't even kill the enforcer? I don't envy you, friend. But a contract's a contract. Just do what you've got to do.	
FormID: 000253E3	Dark05Assassinated	contract	0	For giving you this contract, Ocheeva is wise beyond her years. You will fail in your task, and die in the process.	
FormID: 000253E4	Dark05Assassinated	contract	0	The enforcer will not appreciate your little show. He'll likely attack you on sight, but you must resist the urge to fight back!	
FormID: 000253E5	Dark05Assassinated	contract	0	Remember, timing is everything. You need to slash Motierre with the blade in Hides-His-Heart's presence, and then flee before the enforcer can react.	
FormID: 000253E6	Dark05Assassinated	contract	0	Bah! You have neither the skill nor the daring to fulfill this contract. I hope the moneylender cuts out your heart.	
FormID: 000253E7	Dark05Assassinated	contract	0	It just so happens I am familiar with the Chorrol Chapel Undercroft. You're as good as dead.	
FormID: 000253E8	Dark05Assassinated	contract	0	I once slept in the Chorrol Chapel Undercroft. It's damp, cold... and cursed! Getting Motierre out of there may be a challenge.	
FormID: 00023E70	Dark03Accidents	contract	0	You are to travel to Bruma, enter the house of the Wood Elf Baenlin, and kill him. It should look like an accident. I'm sure you can handle it.	
FormID: 00023419	Dark03Accidents	contract	0	The manservant's name is Gromm, you say? Sounds like a Nord. Probably a big one. If he catches you, get ready for a serious fight. 	
FormID: 000251B1	Dark03Accidents	contract	0	What's the matter? You can't kill an old man? Want Gogron to hold your hand? You make me sick!	
FormID: 000251B4	Dark03Accidents	contract	0	If the target is old and weak, as you say, then his manservant is sure to be quite the opposite. Best stay out of his way.	
FormID: 000251B5	Dark03Accidents	contract	0	I could help you, yes. But I won't. Your failure will give me much joy.	
FormID: 000251BD	Dark03Accidents	contract	0	Yes, you'll find that some jobs require you to terminate a mark in a specific way. It's well worth the trouble, considering how good the bonuses are.	
FormID: 000251BF	Dark03Accidents	contract	0	This contract requires stealth and subtlety. You possess neither. When you fail, I will gladly take your place.	
FormID: 000251C5	Dark03Accidents	contract	0	How do you plan on entering this man's house? Through the front door? Be smart and look for a more inconspicuous way in, like a cellar entrance.	
FormID: 000251C7	Dark03Accidents	contract	0	That manservant is going to squash you like a bug! I can't wait to see what's left of you.	
FormID: 000251CD	Dark03Accidents	contract	0	If things go badly, forgo the plan and simply kill the mark any way you can. You'll lose the bonus, but at least the contract will be fulfilled. 	
FormID: 000251D1	Dark03Accidents	contract	0	For the love of Sithis, you have to kill a feeble old man. Is that too much for you to handle?	
FormID: 00023E45	Dark01KnifeFIN	contract	0	A contract is a secret pact one enters into with the Dark Brotherhood. They provide us with gold, and we remove someone from existence.	
FormID: 00023E45	Dark01KnifeFIN	contract	1	A contract is fulfilled by a skilled assassin such as yourself, who keeps the Dark Brotherhood's end of the bargain. So it has always been. 	
FormID: 00023E45	Dark01KnifeFIN	contract	2	While carrying out a contract, you may have the opportunity to earn a bonus if certain parameters are met. Now, let's begin, shall we?	
FormID: 00023E45	Dark01KnifeFIN	contract	3	I'm not sure how you feel about pirates, but you've got to kill one. A captain, in fact. On his ship. Surrounded by his crew. Interested?	
FormID: 00003885	Dark01KnifeFIN	contract	0	Your first contract requires the killing of a pirate captain, on his ship. Are you ready to accept?	
FormID: 00023F0A	Dark02Watery	contract	0	As a pirate, Gaston Tussaud has certainly spilled his share of blood. Someone wants revenge, and they've hired us to extract it. 	
FormID: 0002511B	Dark02Watery	contract	0	Pirates, eh? They tend to be quick, and good with a blade, but don't favor armor. They're not fond of bows or spells, either.	
FormID: 00003460	Dark02Watery	contract	0	So, your first contract. No chance for a bonus, huh? That's all right, you're better off! Who needs magic items when you've got raw skill?	
FormID: 00003460	Dark02Watery	contract	1	And the great thing about killing a target up close and personal is you can talk to 'em before you do it! You know, say something scary!	
FormID: 00003460	Dark02Watery	contract	2	For example, this one time, I had a contract to kill a little Nord girl at her birthday party. She asked me if I was the jester!	
FormID: 00003460	Dark02Watery	contract	3	So I said to her, [QUOTE]No, I am a messenger of death.[QUOTE] You should have seen the look on her face! Ha ha ha ha! Anyway, she won't be seeing age six! 	
FormID: 000251B0	Dark02Watery	contract	0	What's the matter, can't handle the pressure? Or maybe you're just... weak.	
FormID: 000251B8	Dark02Watery	contract	0	You come crying to me for help? Perhaps Lucien Lachance was wrong about you after all, eh?	
FormID: 000251BB	Dark02Watery	contract	0	I've traveled by prison ship. It was cramped and dark. There was little room to move around, but plenty of shadowy nooks to hide in. Remember that.  	
FormID: 000251BE	Dark02Watery	contract	0	Ha! The great assassin needs help fulfilling a contract. You'll get no aid from me.	
FormID: 000251C6	Dark02Watery	contract	0	The Marie Elena, you say? I've seen that ship. There's a unique balcony at the stern. My guess is it leads to the captain's cabin. Could be useful.	
FormID: 000251C8	Dark02Watery	contract	0	So, you come to me for assistance. How interesting. I think I'd much rather you die in the field.	
FormID: 000251CF	Dark02Watery	contract	0	I killed a pirate once. Of course the ship was out to sea at the time. Somewhere between Vvardenfell and Solstheim. Now those were the days. 	
FormID: 000251D0	Dark02Watery	contract	0	I serve Lucien Lachance and the Dark Brotherhood, and will guide you as directed. But you will get no additional help from me.	
FormID: 00023E73	Dark04ExecutionFIN	contract	0	We're usually called upon to take a life, but not this time. This contract requires us to stage the assassination of a marked man. Are you ready?	
FormID: 00023E47	Dark02WateryFIN	contract	0	We need you to stage an... accident. Kill the target in the manner specified, and you'll receive a considerable bonus. Do you accept this contract?	
FormID: 00023E72	Dark03AccidentsFIN	contract	0	Ever broken out of jail? How do you feel about breaking into one? The Imperial Prison, to be exact. We need a prisoner... silenced. Can you do it?	
FormID: 000233D8	Dark04Execution	contract	0	You must infiltrate the Imperial Prison and kill Valen Dreth, a Dark Elf. He should be easy enough to eliminate, once you actually get inside.  	
FormID: 00023400	Dark04Execution	contract	0	Infiltrating the Imperial Prison is no small matter. Those guards are heavily armed and professionally trained. If discovered, don't be a fool. Flee!	
FormID: 000251AF	Dark04Execution	contract	0	I can only pray that you break the Tenets and surrender to the guards. I will beg Lucien for the right to kill you.	
FormID: 000251B2	Dark04Execution	contract	0	I know those sewers well. They will allow you access to the prison, but are home to some fearsome creatures. Tread carefully.	
FormID: 000251B7	Dark04Execution	contract	0	You will not make it past the sewers. Of this I am certain.	
FormID: 000251BA	Dark04Execution	contract	0	This prisoner, why give him a chance to escape, or fight back? Pierce his heart with an arrow, right through the bars of the cell. Quick and easy. 	
FormID: 000251C2	Dark04Execution	contract	0	Vicente wants YOU to infiltrate the Imperial Prison? I didn't realize you had such a good sense of humor.	
FormID: 000251C4	Dark04Execution	contract	0	The Imperial Prison! Long did I languish there, in my youth, before the Brotherhood found me.  The guards are strong and cruel. So very cruel....	
FormID: 000251CA	Dark04Execution	contract	0	I can only hope the prison guards do to you what they did to me. You will know the true definition of the word [QUOTE]horror.[QUOTE]	
FormID: 000251CC	Dark04Execution	contract	0	No Dark Brother or Sister has successfully infiltrated the Imperial Prison in over three hundred years. This will be a true test of your abilities.	
FormID: 000251D2	Dark04Execution	contract	0	I was hoping Vicente would give you this contract. When you are captured and killed, the assignment will go to someone more competent.	
FormID: 000275C3	Dark08Whodunit	contract	0	Each guest, at some point in the past, wronged their mysterious host. Now he's hired us to exact his revenge.	
FormID: 000275C4	Dark08Whodunit	contract	0	If you really plan on killing the guests one by one, make sure that when you strike, you strike hard. Don't want anyone running for help, do you?    	
FormID: 000275C5	Dark08Whodunit	contract	0	What's the matter, five targets too much for you? If Vicente gave me that contract I'd be home before supper.	
FormID: 000275CB	Dark08Whodunit	contract	0	The key to successfully completing this contract is effectively blending in with the other guests. So for Sithis' sake, do not wear your hood...	
FormID: 00027988	Dark08Whodunit	contract	0	So, it's to be five against one, is it? The odds are against you. With any luck, you'll be dead within an hour.	
FormID: 00027989	Dark08Whodunit	contract	0	I take much joy in giving you this contract. With so many targets come so many opportunities to fail. The chance of you surviving is slim at best.	
FormID: 0002798A	Dark08Whodunit	contract	0	Remember, you must make the other guests feel comfortable. Make them like you. Make them TRUST you. Then bathe in their blood! Hehehehe!	
FormID: 0002798B	Dark08Whodunit	contract	0	Why do you get to go to a party? It's not fair. I hope they discover the truth and kill you in your sleep! 	
FormID: 0002798C	Dark08Whodunit	contract	0	Remember the pretenses under which the guests are there. They will be suspicious. You must be as effective an actor as you are a killer. 	
FormID: 0002798C	Dark08Whodunit	contract	1	It would be a good idea to talk to each guest and appeal to their good disposition. Remember, if they really like you, they may open up to you.	
FormID: 0002798C	Dark08Whodunit	contract	2	You should dress appropriately. The Deceiver's Finery, your recent quest reward, would serve this purpose nicely. If you earned it, that is...	
FormID: 0002798D	Dark08Whodunit	contract	0	You may be a killer, but are you an actor? I think not. The guests will discover your true identity and you will never leave that house alive.	
FormID: 0002798E	Dark08Whodunit	contract	0	Take your time with this one. Observe the other guests. Learn their schedules and behaviors, and strike each one when they're alone. 	
FormID: 0002798E	Dark08Whodunit	contract	1	Use your silver tongue. Try to befriend the guests, and then you may be able to lure them to their own dooms! Hahahahahaha!	
FormID: 00027998	Dark08Whodunit	contract	0	You come to me for knowledge, for advice? I would sooner see you flounder in a pool of your own blood. Good luck, worm.	
FormID: 000275BF	Dark07MedicineFIN	contract	0	Do you like parties? Because you've been invited to one. Of course, you'll be killing all the other guests. Are you ready to attend?	
FormID: 0006EDEE	FGC06Courier	contract	0	They're all dead? Well, you'll have to take over for them. Get back there and clear out that mine. Get moving!	REC
FormID: 000A7872	FGC06Courier	contract	0	You've already cleared that place of all the goblins? Go figure. Fine. Then I guess you don't need to deliver those weapons.	REC
FormID: 00027F85	FGC06Courier	contract	0	Well, you got the weapons there, but there were casualties after. Do better in the future, or don't come to me for work. Here's your reward.	
FormID: 00028889	FGC06Courier	contract	0	You got the weapons there and cleared the mine with no casualties. Better than I expected from you. Here's your reward, and a little bonus.	
FormID: 00027F86	FGC06Courier	contract	0	I suppose I've got something for you. We need a weapons shipment delivered to Desolate Mine. That's your job.	
FormID: 0002F87E	Dark06Wanderer	contract	0	The High Elf Faelian lives in the Imperial City, and fancies long walks. Speak with your fellow family members. They may offer their insights.	
FormID: 0000BCAD	Dark06Wanderer	contract	0	I have given you little more than a name. I can only pray that you'll wander the Imperial City aimlessly for days, and then eventually die of hunger.	
FormID: 0000BCAE	Dark06Wanderer	contract	0	I'd never suggest you forfeit a bonus, of course, but killing Faelian indoors is so unappealing. Too bad you couldn't snipe him from a balcony.	
FormID: 0000BCAE	Dark06Wanderer	contract	1	But first I guess you have to find him, right? The Elven races of the Imperial City are a community unto themselves. Ask them about Faelian.	
FormID: 0000BCAF	Dark06Wanderer	contract	0	So, you need to find this High Elf, hmm? Why don't you take a trip to Summerset Isle, ask around for him there. Idiot. 	
FormID: 0000BCB0	Dark06Wanderer	contract	0	I do so love pursuing a contract in the Imperial City! The alleys, the shadows, the challenge of evading Phillida's Legion troops! I envy you!	
FormID: 0000BCB1	Dark06Wanderer	contract	0	With every unattainable contract my sister gives you, I find myself loving her more and more.	
FormID: 0000BCB2	Dark06Wanderer	contract	0	Now this is what I'm talking about! You kill him up close, face-to-face, and you still get the bonus! I wish all the contracts were like that!	
FormID: 0000BCB3	Dark06Wanderer	contract	0	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! By Sithis, you are an idiot! Ocheeva has sent you on a suicide mission! Phillida's men are going to cut you to pieces!	
FormID: 0000BCB4	Dark06Wanderer	contract	0	The Elves of the Imperial City are a fairly close-knit community. One of them will have at least heard of Faelian. You should ask around.	
FormID: 0000BCB5	Dark06Wanderer	contract	0	I look at you and wonder how you're still alive, considering your utter incompetence as an assassin. With any luck, this contract will be your last.	
FormID: 0000BCB6	Dark06Wanderer	contract	0	Know what I'd do? Talk to Faelian, learn who he is. Maybe then you can lead him to a secluded place. Then, when you're alone... you know! He he he!	
FormID: 0000BCB7	Dark06Wanderer	contract	0	I don't know what idea appeals to me more: you getting killed by this Faelian person or the Imperial Legion using your corpse as a target dummy.	
FormID: 0002F87F	Dark05AssassinatedFIN	contract	0	In the Imperial City there lives a High Elf who must be removed from existence. Finding this person may prove... challenging. Are you interested?	
FormID: 0003005C	Dark06WandererFIN	contract	0	Far to the west there lives a fierce warlord and his company of loyal mercenaries. Your target is the warlord. Do you accept this contract?  	
FormID: 00035DFF	Dark09Retirement	contract	0	Adamus Phillida will find no rest in retirement. No, his soul will endure a kind of eternal suffering known only to those who have angered Sithis.	
FormID: 000039DD	Dark09Retirement	contract	0	It's not my place to question the wisdom of Lucien Lachance or the Black Hand, but trusting you with the Rose of Sithis? It is... folly.	
FormID: 000039DE	Dark09Retirement	contract	0	The Rose of Sithis! Such an honor! Just make sure your marksmanship is up to the task. If you miss the target, the enchantment will be wasted.	
FormID: 000039DF	Dark09Retirement	contract	0	Ah, of course. You're going to succeed where three previous family members have failed. How silly of me...	
FormID: 000039E0	Dark09Retirement	contract	0	The Rose will only work if Phillida is unarmored. So, when would a soldier not wear his armor? I only take my armor off to sleep or swim...	
FormID: 000039E1	Dark09Retirement	contract	0	One of my dear friends was killed while trying to kill Phillida, several years ago. He was twice the assassin you are! Your are doomed to failure.	
FormID: 000039E2	Dark09Retirement	contract	0	Hmm. Don't get me wrong, that magic arrow sounds nice and all, but it seems to me like you don't even need to use it to get the bonus.	
FormID: 000039E2	Dark09Retirement	contract	1	As long as you cut off his finger and leave it in that desk, you'll get your bonus. Sounds to me like you can kill the old sod anyway you'd like.	
FormID: 000039E2	Dark09Retirement	contract	2	So what if he's wearing armor! You think that Imperial Legion scrap can stop a well-forged claymore? Not bloody likely! Ha ha ha ha ha!	
FormID: 000039E3	Dark09Retirement	contract	0	You're going to kill Adamus Phillida? You? Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, it'll be a retirement, all right. Yours!	
FormID: 000039E4	Dark09Retirement	contract	0	Phillida may be retired, but he'll likely have a bodyguard, probably a member of the Leyawiin City Watch. You may have to dispose of him as well.	
FormID: 000039E5	Dark09Retirement	contract	0	What madness has stricken the Black Hand, that they would trust such an important task to someone so very useless?	
FormID: 000039E6	Dark09Retirement	contract	0	Oh! You're being sent to kill Phillida? I hope the Rose of Sithis pierces his heart and sends his soul screaming into the Void!	
FormID: 000039E7	Dark09Retirement	contract	0	You're being sent to assassinate Adamus Phillida? Oh, finally Ocheeva has come to her senses! You'll be killed, and we'll finally be rid of you!     	
FormID: 00035DF1	Dark08WhodunitFIN	contract	0	Do you recall the name Adamus Phillida? The Imperial Legion pest? It's time he joined Sithis in the Void. Think you're up to the task?

FormID: 0000392E	FGC05Stone	contract	0	Well done! You've put in good work for me. I only wish I had more. Things are a little lean right now, as I'm sure you know. Here's your payment.	
FormID: 00003935	FGC05Stone	contract	0	You need to find the Stone of St. Alessia and return it to Cirroc at the Chapel of Talos in Bruma. Now, get to it.

FormID: 00061459	Dark10Sanctuary	contract	0	Lucien Lachance's word is law. Whatever contract he has given you must be carried out, without question.	
FormID: 0006145A	Dark10Sanctuary	contract	0	Lachance would not have selected you for a contract unless he had the utmost confidence in your abilities. Best not let him down.	
FormID: 0006145B	Dark10Sanctuary	contract	0	So, it's a secret contract then, is it? You must be moving up in the world. Congratulations.	
FormID: 0006145C	Dark10Sanctuary	contract	0	Lachance has given you a... a secret assignment? But I've been asking for this chance for so long.... Surely he doesn't doubt my abilities!

FormID: 00023E49	Dark02WateryFIN	Dark02FinChoice1B	0	Well then, I suggest you get your affairs in order and return to me as soon as you're able.	
FormID: 0002BA40	NQDChorrol	Nibenese	0	That's what we call folk from the eastern side of Cyrodiil. The old name of the lowland part of Cyrodiil is Nibenay.	
FormID: 00023E53	Dark03AccidentsFIN	Dark03FinChoice1B	0	Hmm. I thought you'd jump at the opportunity to infiltrate the most heavily fortified prison in all of Cyrodiil. Maybe I overestimated you after all.	
FormID: 00023E54	Dark03AccidentsFIN	Dark03FinChoice1A	0	As always, you fail to disappoint me. Your target is a Dark Elf named Valen Dreth. He thinks he's safe in prison. He is tragically mistaken.	
FormID: 00023E54	Dark03AccidentsFIN	Dark03FinChoice1A	1	A prisoner recently escaped from the prison, using a set of secret tunnels connecting to the Imperial City's sewer system. It's a perfect way inside.	
FormID: 00023E54	Dark03AccidentsFIN	Dark03FinChoice1A	2	Just outside the Imperial Prison is a grating that leads to the sewers. It has recently been tightly locked, but I will provide a key.          	
FormID: 00023E54	Dark03AccidentsFIN	Dark03FinChoice1A	3	It should be easy enough to locate Dreth in his small cell. Besides, I think you know the way, hmmm. He he he he he.	
FormID: 00023E54	Dark03AccidentsFIN	Dark03FinChoice1A	4	Valen Dreth has been imprisoned for many years. His tongue is sharp, but his body is limp and frail. He will prove an easy, pleasurable kill.	
FormID: 00023E54	Dark03AccidentsFIN	Dark03FinChoice1A	5	You will receive a bonus if you fulfill the contract without killing any of the prison guards. Now go, and may the Night Mother go with you.	
FormID: 00023E48	Dark02WateryFIN	Dark02FinChoice1A	0	As I expected. Good. The target is a Wood Elf named Baenlin. You will find him at his home in Bruma. Enter secretly, and avoid his manservant, Gromm.	
FormID: 00023E48	Dark02WateryFIN	Dark02FinChoice1A	1	On the second floor is a secret door leading to a crawlspace. Inside are the fastenings of a mounted head that hangs over Baenlin's favorite chair.	
FormID: 00023E48	Dark02WateryFIN	Dark02FinChoice1A	2	Loosen those fastenings any night between 8:00pm and 11:00pm, and the head will surely fall on Baenlin as he relaxes in his chair, as is his custom.	
FormID: 00023E48	Dark02WateryFIN	Dark02FinChoice1A	3	If Baenlin is eliminated in any other manner, or if the manservant Gromm is killed, you will forfeit the bonus. Now go, and may Sithis be with you.

FormID: 00028ABF	MS16A	WeatherleahTopic	0	We look forward to returning to our family's ancestral home at Weatherleah, once the ogres are dead.	
FormID: 00028AC2	MS16A	WeatherleahTopic	0	I wish my father had given me a better description of its location, but for some reason all he told me was [QUOTE]South of Chorrol, north of Fort Carmala.[QUOTE]	
FormID: 000242AE	MS16A	WeatherleahTopic	0	Weatherleah was our family's home for generations. Our parents fled it when ogres attacked; they became separated.	
FormID: 000242AE	MS16A	WeatherleahTopic	1	My father carried me to safety. He later returned and believed Reynald and my mother had perished.	
FormID: 000242AE	MS16A	WeatherleahTopic	2	Since ogres are cannibals, he didn't expect to find their bodies. Thankfully, however, it seems that my mother managed to carry Reynald to safety.	
FormID: 000242AE	MS16A	WeatherleahTopic	3	While my mother didn't survive, Reynald did, and for that I'm grateful. But we both want more - we want our home back.	
FormID: 000242AE	MS16A	WeatherleahTopic	4	We're not fighters; you appear to have more skill than either of us. Would you go to Weatherleah, and see if it's still inhabited by ogres?

FormID: 00088B2F	MS16A	WeatherleahTopic	0	Hmmmm... let me see.	
FormID: 00088B2F	MS16A	WeatherleahTopic	1	Oh, yes. I remember. I think it's directly south of Chorrol. Place was overrun with ogres though. Nasty brutes.	
FormID: 00088B2F	MS16A	WeatherleahTopic	2	Here, let me show you where it is on your map.	
FormID: 00088B30	MS16A	WeatherleahTopic	0	So... the brothers have once again reclaimed Weatherleah, eh? Good for them!	
FormID: 000878D6	MS16A	WeatherleahTopic	0	Yes, I've heard of the place, but I'm not sure where it is. I think your best bet would be to speak to Sabine Laul at the Fighters Guild.

FormID: 00023E88	MS16	GuilbertJemaneTopic	0	What? Either I'm far too drunk, or I'm misunderstanding you. I have a brother? How can that be?	
FormID: 00023E88	MS16	GuilbertJemaneTopic	1	My family was killed long, long ago. At least, that's what I'd been told... perhaps it's time for me to stop drinking.	
FormID: 00023E88	MS16	GuilbertJemaneTopic	2	And he's coming here to see me, you say? Yes, I'd better sober up.	
FormID: 000242A9	MS16	ReynaldJemaneTopic	0	My poor brother. I can't help but feel responsible. If he'd never known about me, he'd still be alive.	
FormID: 000242B9	MS16	ReynaldJemaneTopic	0	He's Reynald. I'm Guilbert.	
FormID: 00023E83	MS16	ReynaldJemaneTopic	0	He.... he's alive?	
FormID: 00023E83	MS16	ReynaldJemaneTopic	1	I was told that my mother and brother never survived! This is amazing!	
FormID: 00023E83	MS16	ReynaldJemaneTopic	2	I'll need to go see him at once! You'll have to excuse me; I'd better leave right away.	
FormID: 00023E83	MS16	ReynaldJemaneTopic	3	But, please -- come and see us in Chorrol. It would be wonderful for us both to be able to thank you for helping us find each other again.	
FormID: 00023E87	MS16	ReynaldJemaneTopic	0	Yes, that's me. And apparently some other fellow, as well. Strange thing, that. Knowing that someone else is also you... makes my head hurt.	
FormID: 00084A98	MS16	ReynaldJemaneTopic	0	Mystery solved, eh? Reynald had a twin brother. Well, he had all of us fooled.	
FormID: 00094075	MS16	ReynaldJemaneTopic	0	Reynald Jemane? No, don't know anyone by that name. There's a Guilbert Jemane in town however. Maybe he can help you.	XXX Elf Female, Orc Female = [QUOTE]No, I don't know anyone...[QUOTE]

FormID: 00084A99	MS16	ReynaldJemaneTopic	0	Yes, it's quite odd. Reynald, who I've bumped into several times in Chorrol, acted like I was a complete stranger.	
FormID: 00084A99	MS16	ReynaldJemaneTopic	1	Also, he seemed sober, which is a refreshing change. Usually Reynald is stumbling around Chorrol drunk as can be.	
FormID: 00084A99	MS16	ReynaldJemaneTopic	2	Very odd, but then, it's really none of my business.

FormID: 00038FB3	MQ08	MQ08ArtifactG	0	A fearsome weapon, and steeped in the ancient evil of its master. May its deadly power turn good, for once.	
FormID: 00038FB4	MQ08	MQ08ArtifactH	0	I'll sleep better once this keepsake of Namira is gone from my possession. A good choice for our purpose, though.	
FormID: 00038FB5	MQ08	MQ08ArtifactI	0	The merchants of Cyrodiil would sleep more soundly, knowing this Key is gone from the world. But why tell them?	
FormID: 00038FB6	MQ08	MQ08ArtifactJ	0	Not many people would give up Spellbreaker for destruction, my friend. Your sacrifice honors me.

FormID: 00038FB8	MQ08	MQ08ArtifactL	0	Good riddance to this tool of mischief.

FormID: 00026E76	DarkConversations	DarkOrcElfConvo	0	My dear Gogron, you are a life-taker for the Dark Brotherhood! Our very existence relies on shadow and deception. Do you not value our secrets?	
FormID: 00026E79	DarkConversations	DarkOrcElfConvo	0	Yes, yes, of course I value our secrets, and I have never betrayed them! But using stealth to kill.... It's just so... weak.	
FormID: 00026E7A	DarkConversations	DarkOrcElfConvo	0	But Brother, what of the contracts that require subtlety! You must at least strive to earn the bonuses that are offered?	
FormID: 00026E7B	DarkConversations	DarkOrcElfConvo	0	Bonuses? Ha ha ha ha ha! Useless, I say! Gold and magical trinkets are no substitute for the freedom to slaughter anyone I please, at any time!

FormID: 000270ED	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	1	I cannot spare any soldiers as long as Chorrol remains under threat from the Oblivion Gate outside our walls.	
FormID: 000270EF	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	Mehrunes Dagon has no more love for my kind than for my mortal subjects. Less, perhaps, as we make poor slaves.	
FormID: 000270EF	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	1	You have helped me by closing the Oblivion Gate near Skingrad. I will likewise help you by sending aid to Bruma.	
FormID: 000270F1	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	While Skingrad is threatened by an Oblivion Gate, I cannot spare any soldiers for Bruma.	
FormID: 000270F1	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	1	Whatever you may think of me, I still protect my own. This is my city, and Mehrunes Dagon will not have it while I remain Count of Skingrad.

FormID: 00056E69	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	The Count left very specific instructions. He does not want to see you again on this matter until the Oblivion Gate outside Skingrad is closed.	
FormID: 00056E6A	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	I believe the Count may want to handle this matter personally.	
FormID: 00056E6A	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	1	Wait here. I will tell the Count you are waiting to see him.	
FormID: 00056E6B	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	The Count has instructed me to tell you that he will be happy to speak to you again once the Oblivion Gate threatening Skingrad is closed.

FormID: 00026E95	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	I would like to send help, but unfortunately my guard is short-handed with the death of Captain Lerus. I need all my soldiers at home right now.	
FormID: 00026E96	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	Thank you for closing the Oblivion Gate that was threatening Bravil. I will send my guard captain, Viera Lerus, to Bruma's aid.	
FormID: 00026E97	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	I've sent Captain Lerus to Bruma. She is one of my best soldiers. I'm glad to be able to help defend the heir to the throne.	
FormID: 00026E9B	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	I wish I could help. I understand the need to help defend the heir to the throne. It is a duty we all share.	
FormID: 00026E9B	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	1	But with an Oblivion Gate threatening Bravil, I need all my soldiers here.	
FormID: 00026E9C	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	I've heard that you closed the Oblivion Gate outside Anvil. I honor you for your bravery and service to my city.	
FormID: 00026E9C	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	1	With Anvil safe for the moment, I will send some of my best soldiers to bolster the Bruma garrison.	
FormID: 00026E9E	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	Don't worry. Anvil's soldiers are worth two from anywhere else. Bruma will not fall!	
FormID: 00026E9F	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	I would like to send help to Bruma, but I cannot risk weakening Anvil's defenses with that Oblivion Gate open outside the city.	
FormID: 00026EA0	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	I will not forget your service to me and to Cheydinhal. Rescuing my son from the Oblivion Gate was a daring feat.	
FormID: 00026EA0	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	1	With the Oblivion Gate closed, I can now gladly send aid to Bruma.	
FormID: 00058B35	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	I will not forget your service to Cheydinhal. Closing the Oblivion Gate outside the city was a daring feat.	
FormID: 00058B35	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	1	I do not blame you for my son's death. He brought that upon himself, as hard as it is for a father to admit.	
FormID: 00058B35	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	2	Since the immediate threat to Cheydinhal is now eliminated, I will grant your request and send reinforcements to Bruma.	
FormID: 00026EA1	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	My soldiers are brave and capable. They will do their duty.	
FormID: 00026EA2	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	My first responsibility is to the people of Cheydinhal. They look to me for protection in these dark times. 	
FormID: 00026EA2	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	1	With an open Oblivion Gate just outside our walls, I cannot risk weakening Cheydinhal's defenses, even for such a worthy cause.	
FormID: 00026EA3	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	Well, with the Oblivion Gate near Leyawiin closed, I suppose the immediate threat is lessened.	
FormID: 00026EA3	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	1	I will do as you ask. Let no one say Leyawiin did not do its part to uphold the Empire.	
FormID: 00026EA4	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	I have given you the help you asked for. Bruma's fate is out of my hands.	
FormID: 00026EA5	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	Leyawiin is beset by enemies. The Empire does nothing to help us. Even before this crisis, I did not have enough men to patrol my borders.	
FormID: 00026EA5	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	1	Now, daedra are pouring out of an Oblivion Gate on our very doorstep! No, I don't have any men to spare. Bruma will have to look to its own defense.	
FormID: 00026EA6	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	I hate to refuse you, my friend. But with the castle still in the hands of those daedra, I need every soldier I have left.	
FormID: 00026EA9	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	I have few enough men to spare, but you have more than earned our help.	
FormID: 00026EA9	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	1	I will send what aid I can. Bruma must not share the fate of our city!	
FormID: 000270FB	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	Your reputation precedes you, Hero of Kvatch! You have done my city a great service by closing the Oblivion Gate.	
FormID: 000270FB	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	1	I will now gladly send soldiers to aid in the defense of Bruma. Consider it done.	
FormID: 000ADD08	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	This is terrible news. Under normal circumstances, I would dispatch a legion or two to Bruma immediately.	
FormID: 000ADD08	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	1	But the circumstances are not normal, are they?

FormID: 000ADD08	MQ11	MQ11BrumaAllies	4	I'm sorry, but the cities of Cyrodiil will have to fend for themselves for the time being.	
FormID: 000270EC	MQ00	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	Bruma cannot hold off the hordes of Oblivion alone. You should ask the rulers of the other cities of Cyrodiil to send help.	
FormID: 000270EE	MQ00	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	I had hoped for more help. The Empire will stand or fall with Bruma! Have all the other cities abandoned us?	
FormID: 000270F0	MQ00	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	Your efforts are starting to pay off. Just knowing we do not stand alone has raised the morale of the Bruma Guard.	
FormID: 000270F0	MQ00	MQ11BrumaAllies	1	But I still fear that Bruma will fall before you can complete the ritual. You need to buy Martin more time. Bruma needs more help!	
FormID: 000270F2	MQ00	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	You've done well. The Bruma garrison is much stronger now. We should be able to put up a good fight even against a determined assault.	
FormID: 000270F2	MQ00	MQ11BrumaAllies	1	I hope it is enough. Bruma must hold out until you can complete the ritual and retrieve the Amulet from Mankar Camoran.	
FormID: 000270F3	MQ00	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	You've done better than I had hoped. Bruma's garrison is now as strong as we can make it.	
FormID: 00058E0A	MQ00	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	Won't anyone else send help? We can't be the only city willing to come to Bruma's aid.	
FormID: 00058E0B	MQ00	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	Well... some is better than none. But more is always better. Honestly, I'd be happier if we had more men.	
FormID: 00058E0C	MQ00	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	We'll give them a good fight. They'll know they tangled with the best Cyrodiil has to offer.	
FormID: 000BE326	MQ00	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	None of the other cities have sent aid. Bruma stands alone.	
FormID: 000BE327	MQ00	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	Only one city has sent aid. My guardsmen are the best in Cyrodiil, but they were never meant to be an army.	
FormID: 000BE328	MQ00	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	Several of the cities have sent aid. They're mustering on the plaza outside the castle, if you want to review the troops.	
FormID: 000BE329	MQ00	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	Most of the cities have sent aid. You've done an excellent job.	
FormID: 000BE32A	MQ00	MQ11BrumaAllies	0	All of the other cities have sent aid! It's remarkable! I've never seen such unity of purpose. Your leadership has made all the difference.

FormID: 000275CA	Dark07MedicineFIN	Dark07FinChoice1A	4	There is, of course, no chest of gold. The guests will find no key. After you arrive, the doors will be locked behind you, as everyone expects. 	
FormID: 000275CA	Dark07MedicineFIN	Dark07FinChoice1A	5	When all the guests lie dead, you will be free to leave. Now go, see the doorman at Summitmist Manor. He will explain the rest. Have fun.   	
FormID: 000275C9	Dark07MedicineFIN	Dark07FinChoice1B	0	All right. But don't take too long. The other guests are already assembled, and they're waiting on you.	
FormID: 000275C8	Dark08Whodunit	Dark08Choice1A	0	Yes, well... Anyway... Now that we're all here, I guess we can start looking. I'd wish you good luck, but I wouldn't really mean it.      	
FormID: 000275C7	Dark08Whodunit	Dark08Choice1B	0	Oh, you poor dear! Well, this does make things difficult for me. I want to find the gold as much as anyone, but you need it so much more than I do!	
FormID: 000275C6	Dark08Whodunit	Dark08Choice1C	0	Hahaha! Oh, you're a funny one! Good, I'm glad one of us has a sense of humor about all of this. It will make our time here that much more enjoyable.

FormID: 000277B8	Generic	BookResponses	0	I've never read that. Been meaning to pick it up, though. Perhaps I can read it when you're finished.	
FormID: 000277BC	Generic	BookResponses	0	Ah... an excellent read, though it's been a while since I've read it myself. Let me know how you like it.	
FormID: 000277BD	Generic	BookResponses	0	Hmm... not my favorite work, but many enjoy it.	
FormID: 000285B6	Generic	BookResponses	0	That sounds interesting. Perhaps I'll have to read it as well.

FormID: 000285BE	Generic	BookResponses	0	I believe I read that some time ago. I'll have to give it another read.	
FormID: 00023893	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	No, I haven't. I've heard that he really knows his way around, though.	
FormID: 00023894	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	I spoke to him recently. He really knows his way around. Knows every tree, rock, and cave in the area.	
FormID: 00023895	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	I don't see a problem with those two. It's a bit odd, but that's their business.	
FormID: 00023896	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	It is awful. Her poor mother. What is Glistel thinking?	
FormID: 00023897	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	I've never run into her there, but I can't blame her for enjoying the matches. Almost everyone likes them.	
FormID: 000238AA	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	Have I seen her there? Of course! She certainly loves a good fight.	
FormID: 000238AB	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	I was in there just a few days ago. Rasheda's prices are very reasonable.	
FormID: 000238AC	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	I haven't been in a while, but it's always nice to stop in and chat with Rasheda. Plus, she always gives a better deal to her friends.	
FormID: 000238AD	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	Odd noises? No, I haven't. That sounds a bit troublesome.	
FormID: 000238AE	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	I thought I heard something the other night. It's none of my business, though.	
FormID: 000238AF	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	Odd folks, the way they dote on those dogs. They're not hurting anyone, though, so it's no concern of mine.	
FormID: 000238B0	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	I've seen them. Everyone likes a good dog, but they're an odd couple.	
FormID: 000238B1	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	I've made some bets. Won some, lost some.	
FormID: 000238B2	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	Not much for wagering, myself. Of course, I always seem to lose....	
FormID: 000238B3	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	I've made a few bets. Made some good money, actually!	
FormID: 000238B4	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	I haven't done too much betting. Can't say I know enough about the folks fighting to make a smart wager.	
FormID: 000238B5	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	Do I like the fights? Of course! Everyone likes the fights! The thrill of battle, the sting of defeat. A wonderful time.	
FormID: 000238B6	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	Horrible things, those Arena matches. Simply bloodshed for the sake of bloodshed. Barbaric, I tell you.	
FormID: 000238B7	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	I thought about it when I was younger, but it just wasn't for me.	
FormID: 000238B8	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	I never really thought about it. They just didn't seem like the sort of folks I wanted to spend time with.	
FormID: 000238B9	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	I've often thought about joining the Fighters Guild. I've heard you can make a good living there.	
FormID: 000238BA	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	I've never really thought about it. I've heard the money is good, but that's a bit too much risk for me.	
FormID: 000238BB	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	Well, of course. I mean, there's always something there I need. And Seed-Neeus gives a fair price.	
FormID: 000238BC	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	I haven't needed anything there in a while. I'm sure I will soon, though.	
FormID: 000238BD	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	Certainly I've spent time there. Talasma runs a good, quiet Inn.	
FormID: 000238BE	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	I've had many meals at the Oak and Crosier. Sure, it may not be the best in all Cyrodiil, but it suits me fine.	
FormID: 000238BF	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	I bought a fine mare from him once. A fine, fine animal.	
FormID: 000238C0	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	I'm not much of a rider. I've heard others swear by his animals, though.	
FormID: 000238C1	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	He did? Excellent. I wonder if he got [QUOTE]The Lusty Argonian Maid[QUOTE] in. I've been dying to read that.	
FormID: 000238C2	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDQuestionResponses	0	New books? Who has the money to afford all those books? I know I don't.	
FormID: 00027997	Dark08Whodunit	Dark08Choice2A	0	All right, dearie, I understand. If you change your mind, just let me know.	
FormID: 00027996	Dark08Whodunit	Dark08Choice2B	0	Oh, wonderful! This is going to be such fun! So, any ideas where we should begin searching first?	
FormID: 00027995	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	He's young, well-educated and obviously full of himself. Not much different than any young nobleman, really.	
FormID: 00028185	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	That young man has more nobility in his pinky finger than you have in your entire body, you uncultured swine.  	
FormID: 00028186	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	It's obvious that young Primo comes from wealth. A chest full of gold would be mere spending change for him.  	
FormID: 00028187	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Someone turns up dead and you have nothing better to do than pester me about that fine young man? How truly pathetic you are. 	
FormID: 00028188	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Primo is a young man of refinement. This murder must be quite a shock for him.	
FormID: 00028189	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	I worry about the boy. What if the killer is after money? Primo is quite wealthy. He could be the next victim!	
FormID: 0002818A	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Two people lie dead, and all you can do is question me about that sweet boy? I'm beginning to think something is seriously wrong with you. 	
FormID: 0002818B	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	The poor lad is handling all of this better than I expected. It's a testament to his noble bearing, I'm sure.  	
FormID: 0002818C	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	If I may confide in you, dear friend, I'm very worried about the poor boy. The trauma of murders... it could scar him for life! He deserves better.	
FormID: 0002818D	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	You... you're trying to turn me against that sweet boy. Make me think he's the murderer! Get away from me, you fiend! 	
FormID: 0002818E	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	There are only three of us left. All those people... dead. And the killer had to be either Primo... or you! 	
FormID: 0002818F	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Oh, my heavens! Primo must be the killer! I... I never thought it could be him. Please... please! You've got to protect me from him! 	
FormID: 00028190	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Leave me alone, you ghoul! Can't you see I'm mourning for that poor, sweet boy? 	
FormID: 00028191	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	He was so young... so innocent. That boy was destined for greatness. Who could have done such a thing?     	
FormID: 00028192	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	I just can't believe he's dead. He was like a young, beautiful prince. I hope whoever did this can live with themselves.	
FormID: 0002824B	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	I'm sorry, but my feelings for Primo are really none of your concern.  	
FormID: 0002824C	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	He's very handsome. But please don't tell him I said so! Hehe!  	
FormID: 0002824D	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	It's pretty obvious that Primo comes from a wealthy family. He would never be interested in a girl like me, I'm afraid.	
FormID: 00085A64	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	I do hope Primo and I can be, you know...friends. He's so handsome. And he lives a life I can only dream of. I can make him so happy in so many ways.	lewd
FormID: 0002824E	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	You can't possibly think that Primo had anything to do with the murder, do you? That's madness!  	
FormID: 0002824F	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Primo seems kind of nice. I just can't imagine him killing anyone. 	
FormID: 00028250	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	I... I rather like Primo. He's not like the other boys I've known. He has... class. He could never have killed anyone. 	
FormID: 00028251	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Don't try to turn me against Primo! For all I know, you could be the killer!  	
FormID: 00028252	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Two people lie dead. Primo could have done it, I know. He's young, and strong. Still, I don't want to believe that.  	
FormID: 00028253	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	I know Primo could be the killer, but I just don't want to believe it's possible. If... if he likes me, he could take me away with him... 	
FormID: 00028254	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	He can't be the killer! He can't! I won't believe it! Get away from me! 	
FormID: 00028255	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Please... No... Primo can't be the killer. But it's either him... or you...	
FormID: 00028256	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Oh, Azura, no! It's Primo! He's the only one left! He killed them... killed them all! We have to protect ourselves! We have to kill him first!   	
FormID: 00028257	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Get away from me! You're the last person I want to talk to about Primo! 	
FormID: 00028258	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	I... I wanted to get to know him. Be his friend. Maybe... maybe more. I can't believe he's gone.  	
FormID: 0002826C	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Primo was my chance, do you understand me? He was wealthy! He could take me away someplace! Whoever did this will pay!  	
FormID: 000289F4	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	It's a regal name, from a rather regal family. Indeed, my father owns more property than the East Empire Company!	
FormID: 000289F5	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	He's somewhere around here. Why don't you stop wasting my time and go ask him yourself.	
FormID: 000289F6	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Seems like a nice enough kid. A little too rich for his own good, maybe, but I've met worse.	
FormID: 000289F7	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Primo is young and rich. I can sense a good, decent person in there somewhere. He just has to get his priorities straight.	
FormID: 000289F8	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	It's really none of your business what I think about him, now is it?	
FormID: 000289F9	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	I can't imagine someone like Primo has seen much death and suffering. This murder must be quite a shock to him.	
FormID: 000289FA	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Whoever the killer is would have to be strong, and quick. Now, I'm not saying Primo is our murderer, but you have to admit it's at least possible.	
FormID: 000289FB	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	I'm not sure if you're really concerned for the kid or trying to convince me he's a murderer. Either way, I ain't listenin'.	
FormID: 000289FC	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	I'm not sure what to think of the kid anymore. All I know is that two of the guests have been murdered, and he's just dandy. Makes you wonder.	
FormID: 000289FD	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Let me ask you something, friend. Why is Primo even here? The rest of us need the money, but his family is wealthy beyond measure.	
FormID: 000289FD	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	1	Maybe he was bored, or maybe he just wanted to do some slumming. Or maybe he's a trained assassin hired to kill us all, one by one.	
FormID: 000289FD	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	2	Sound crazy? Well these are crazy times, my friend.	
FormID: 000289FE	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	By Ysmir, you've got nerve! Three people are dead! What, are you trying to turn me against Primo now?	
FormID: 000289FF	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	This is madness! There are now only three of us left -- myself, you and Primo. I know I'm not the killer, but what about Primo? What about you?	
FormID: 00028A00	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Besides you and me, he's the only one left! By Ysmir, that boy will pay for what he's done! Come, we must kill Primo before he kills us!	
FormID: 00028A01	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	The lad's dead, you uncaring fool! Now get away from me before you join him!	
FormID: 00028A02	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	That poor boy didn't deserve to die. He was rich! He had no business even being here, looking for treasure that might not even exist.	
FormID: 00028A03	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Primo being here made no sense. Whoever our host is, why would he invite someone who didn't even need the money?	
FormID: 00028A03	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	1	It's as if we were invited for another reason altogether. Think about it. We're trapped in this house, with no way out. And now people start dying.	
FormID: 00028A03	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	2	I think poor Primo was tricked, just like the rest of us. If we're not careful we'll end up dead too. You mark my words.	
FormID: 00028D2D	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	He's young, rich and handsome. Basically the complete opposite of you.	
FormID: 00028D2E	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	He's young, rich and handsome. That's way out of your league, tramp.	
FormID: 00028D2F	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Primo's a blue blood, a noble through-and-through. He thinks he's better than most people, and in most cases he's right.	
FormID: 00028D30	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	I'll confess that I have no idea why Primo is here. The kid's got more wealth than the rest of us combined. He sure doesn't need a chest of gold.	
FormID: 00028D30	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	1	Maybe he's incredibly greedy, but I don't think so. My guess is that Primo is so bored he simply has nothing better to do.	
FormID: 00028F44	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	I hope you're not suggesting that Primo is the murderer? I'm the trained investigator here. Just keep your mouth shut and stay out of my way.	
FormID: 00028F45	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Well, when somebody gets murdered, everyone nearby could be considered a suspect. That includes young Primo.	
FormID: 00028F46	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	To be honest, my instincts tell me the kid isn't the killer. Sure he's a bit obnoxious, but that doesn't make him capable of murder.	
FormID: 00028F47	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	I don't really know what you're trying to accomplish, but questioning me about Primo with two people lying dead just makes me suspect you even more.	
FormID: 00028F48	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Primo may be young, but he's no fool. He knows that the murder of two innocent people doesn't bode well for his own safety.	
FormID: 00028F49	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Primo may be young, but he looks strong, and I'm sure he could handle himself in a fight. I think I'm going to enlist his help.	
FormID: 00028F49	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	1	I'll talk to Primo, give him a bit of encouragement. If he and I are vigilant, we may prevent the killer from claiming another victim.	
FormID: 00028F4A	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	I've come across your kind before. People get murdered, and you ask questions. It's a sure sign of a killer with a guilty conscience. Watch yourself.	
FormID: 00028F4B	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	All right, I'll be honest. I'm not quite sure what to think about Primo anymore. My list of suspects is getting pretty damned small as it is.	
FormID: 00028F4C	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	It's all starting to make sense now. Primo didn't need the money. He has more than any of us. Enough, in fact, to give away an entire chest of gold!	
FormID: 00028F4C	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	1	That rich little bastard lured us all here by appealing to our greed! Don't you see? He considers us all low class, and wants us exterminated!	
FormID: 00028F4C	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	2	That high-born little worm won't get away with this! He'll pay with his life! Come on, you watch my back. I'm going to take Primo down!	
FormID: 0002948D	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	He was a young man and now he's dead, slaughtered like a lamb. I've got my eyes on you, stranger. Don't you forget that.	
FormID: 0002948E	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	I'm still putting the pieces together. Was Primo murdered for his money? Was it something about the chest of gold? I'm not sure yet, but I'm close.	
FormID: 0002948F	Dark08Whodunit	PrimoAntoniusTopic	0	Primo was a young man, strong and full of life. Surely he would have been able to defend himself against an attacker.	
FormID: 00027994	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Oh, that man disgusts me! I find his entire manner offensive. Why, just before you got here he told the most off-color joke about an Argonian maid.	
FormID: 00028177	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	He's a Nord. Mead-swilling barbarians, all of them.	
FormID: 00028178	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	He reminds me of you. Uncultured, unwashed and generally uninteresting.	
FormID: 00028179	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Even if I do think Nels is the killer, I wouldn't share my thoughts with the likes of you. 	
FormID: 0002817A	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	He's an obnoxious drunkard, I know, but I'm not sure if I see him as the murdering type.  	
FormID: 0002817B	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	You think Nels might be the killer? He plays the buffoon, but it could all be an act. He is a Nord, and they're such a savage, uncivilized people.	
FormID: 0002817C	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Why are you trying to turn me against the Nord? Maybe you did, and you're just trying to cover your tracks!	
FormID: 0002817D	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Well, the list of suspects is certainly getting smaller. I didn't think the swine had it in him, but now I'm not so sure.   	
FormID: 0002817E	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Two people dead, yet Nels still lives? I don't think that's a coincidence. Nords are savages, born to kill. I just know he did it! 	
FormID: 0002817F	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	My feelings about the Nord are my own business! Leave me be!	
FormID: 00028180	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	You and Nels... both still alive. One of you is a cold-blooded killer! I... I never did trust that Nord....	
FormID: 00028181	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Oh, please! Save me! Save me from that savage! He'll kill me and then feast on my flesh! That's what Nords do! Please, I don't want to die!	
FormID: 00028182	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	He was a buffoon, but I didn't wish him dead, you cold-hearted villain!  	
FormID: 00028183	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	All right, so I didn't care much for the man. That doesn't mean I wanted him dead.  	
FormID: 00028184	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	So, Nels is dead. I don't condone murder, of course, but I can't say he'll be missed. As a rule, I find Nords rather... vulgar.     	
FormID: 0002822F	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	It's none of your business how I feel about him.	
FormID: 00028230	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	I wonder what makes him so [QUOTE]Naughty[QUOTE]? He seems nice enough to me.	
FormID: 00028231	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Every now and then he looks over at me and smiles. I think he's sweet on me. If Nels finds the gold, maybe he'll want some company. 	
FormID: 00028240	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	So, you think Nels did it, do you? I would appreciate you keeping your opinions to yourself.	
FormID: 00028241	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	I don't know what to make of all this, but I'm not sure I see Nels as a murderer.    	
FormID: 00028242	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Do you think he could have done it? He comes across as something of a drunk, but you never can tell what someone is capable of. 	
FormID: 00028243	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Look, I don't know who is responsible for this madness, so stop trying to taint my opinion of Nels. 	
FormID: 00028244	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	I just don't know what to make of Nels anymore. He plays the bumbling drunkard, but he could very well be the killer. 	
FormID: 00028245	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Can I be honest with you? Nels won't stop looking at me. At first I was flattered. But now he's scaring me! He could be the killer! I could be next!	
FormID: 00028246	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Either you or Nels is the killer! I can't trust either of you, so just stay away from me!  	
FormID: 00028247	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Please, just leave me alone! Either you or Nels is a murderer. I just don't know who to trust anymore!	
FormID: 00028248	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	It's Nels! He's the murderer! We have to get him before he gets us! Do you understand what I'm saying? We have to kill Nels!	
FormID: 00028249	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Don't you even care that Nels is dead? Maybe you killed him! 	
FormID: 0002824A	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	The way he looked at me. It was flattering at first, and then... oh, who could have done this? Why would anyone kill Nels?   	
FormID: 0002826D	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	To be honest, I started getting a bad feeling about Nels. But now he's dead! I... I should have gotten to know him better. Now it's too late.    	
FormID: 000286DB	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	He's a Nord. Even a complete idiot could see that. So what does that say about you?    	
FormID: 000286DC	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	There's something about Nels I can't quite place. He's not from money, that's obvious. But I don't think he's quite the buffoon he seems, either.	
FormID: 000286DD	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Nels is a drunk. He's doesn't even try to hide that fact. But what else is he? When the liquor has dried, what remains of the man? 	
FormID: 000286DD	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	1	I think Nels drinks to forget, maybe about some tragedy in his life. He plays the buffoon, but I sense a deep sadness in him.	
FormID: 000286DE	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Are you trying to insinuate that Nels might be the killer? Maybe I think you did it. After all, murder is a common crime of the... low-born. 	
FormID: 000286ED	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Nels seems just as unnerved as the rest of us that someone has been killed, but he seems to find solace in a bottle. 	
FormID: 000286EE	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Before the body turned up, I got the sense that Nels was a bit of a drunkard. But he seems truly unnerved now, and is drinking rather excessively. 	
FormID: 000286EF	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Damn it man, two people are dead! Have you nothing better to do than question me about the Nord? 	
FormID: 000286F0	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	He's drinking even more than he was before. Is it because he's afraid, or feeling guilty? 	
FormID: 000286F1	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	To be honest, I'm not sure if I trust him. He's a hard drinker, but there's something more. Something in his eyes, hard and calculating.  	
FormID: 000286F2	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	You want me to think Nels is the killer, is that it? Maybe you did it, eh? Maybe you're just trying to turn me against him!  	
FormID: 000286F3	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	I just don't know what to think. I had my doubts about Nels, and he is still alive. Could it be true? Could he have killed all of them?	
FormID: 000286F4	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	I was right about him! He's been doing it, he's the killer! My friend... you and I have to end this. We must kill Nels before he kills us!	
FormID: 000286F5	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	He's dead, and one of us killed him. Maybe it was you, eh? Maybe he found the gold, and you murdered him for it! 	
FormID: 000286F6	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Someone killed the man, but who? And for what reason? We may never know.	
FormID: 00028715	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	I was thinking, maybe Nels found the chest of gold, and one of the others killed him for it! We've got to be careful, my friend, or we could be next!	
FormID: 00028A04	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Ah, don't let the name fool you. I had a bit too much mead a few years back, and there was this tavern wench.... Anyway, just call me Nels.	
FormID: 00028C35	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Why don't you and that barbarian climb back under your rock.	
FormID: 00028C36	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Nels is a Nord, and like all Nords he's a lawless barbarian with no respect for authority.	
FormID: 00028C37	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Know what I think? I think that barbarian will do anything to get his hands on the chest of gold. His kind are greedy and vicious, all of them.	
FormID: 00028C37	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	1	Trust me, I know. I was stationed at Fort Frostmoth for a few years, on the isle of Solstheim. Those Nords are a bunch of animal-worshipping savages.	
FormID: 00028C37	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	2	They're all the same, full of mead and something to prove. We lost a lot of good men up there. A lot of good men.	
FormID: 00028C38	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Someone's been killed, and you know what my real problem is? Trying to decide who did it, you or that worthless Nord.	
FormID: 00028C39	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	When people start turning up dead, it's usually a good idea to keep your eyes on any nearby Nords, if you understand what I'm saying.	
FormID: 00028C3A	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Nords are raised to be cold-blooded killers. Don't take your eyes off Nels if you value your life. I'll bet anything he's our murderer.	
FormID: 00028CD2	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Now this is interesting. Two people turn up dead, and you're more concerned with my feelings toward the Nord. 	
FormID: 00028CD2	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	1	If I didn't know better, I'd say you were trying to turn me against him to cover your own tracks.	
FormID: 00028CD3	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Two people are dead, and the only thing the Nord can do is dive into a bottle of beer. If you ask me it's all an act.  	
FormID: 00028CD3	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	1	Nels killed those people and pretty soon he'll come for the rest of it. Don't you worry, when I gather more evidence, I'll take that scum down!	
FormID: 00028CD4	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	My friend, in talking to you, it's become clear what must be done. I have no doubts in my mind that Nels is the killer. We must take him down!	
FormID: 00028CD4	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	1	We've got to kill that cold-loving bastard before he turns on us! You cover me while I strike the killing blow!	
FormID: 00028CD5	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	That mead-swilling barbarian killed those two people, I'm sure of it! I don't have the proof just yet, but I'm watching him.	
FormID: 00028CD5	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	1	Don't you worry, my friend. Nels won't get away with this. Not on my watch.	
FormID: 00028CD6	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	I was positive he was the killer until you opened your mouth. Now I'm not so sure.	
FormID: 00028CD7	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	My gut instincts tell me Nels is the killer, but still I lack the proof I need to confront him. Maybe you can convince me I'm right.	
FormID: 00028CD8	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Nels is dead. You know what that means? You've just shot to the top of my suspect list. You make one wrong move and I'll break you!	
FormID: 00028CD9	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	Can't say I'm sorry to see there's one less Nord in the world. Still, I don't appreciate someone getting murdered right under my nose.	
FormID: 00028CDA	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	The Nord has been murdered. Maybe I'll get lucky and the same thing will happen to you. Unless, of course, you're the one who did it....	
FormID: 00028CDB	Dark08Whodunit	NelsTheNaughtyTopic	0	One less Nord in the world is something I'd normally cheer about, but the fact that he was murdered by a fellow guest does put a damper on things.	
FormID: 00027993	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	That's right. It's a Breton name. I'll have you know the Petits are one of High Rock's oldest and most respected noble families.	
FormID: 00028232	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	She's all right, I guess. Not that it's any business of yours.  	
FormID: 00028233	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Well, I don't really know her, but she seems like a very respectable old lady. 	
FormID: 00028234	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Honestly? I don't think she likes me. It's because I'm a Dunmer. I heard her say something to Neville, and it wasn't very nice.  	
FormID: 00028235	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	So what are you trying to tell me? That Matilde is the killer? Why are you trying to turn me against her? 	
FormID: 00028236	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Well, she does seem genuinely upset that someone's been killed. Not that I'm ruling her out as a suspect, mind you.  	
FormID: 00028237	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	I don't trust that old hag. She pretends she likes you, and then stabs you in the back. Who knows. Maybe she'll REALLY stab you in the back.	
FormID: 00028238	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Okay, so I don't like Matilde. What makes you think I like you any better? 	
FormID: 00028239	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Could it be possible? Could an old lady be a murderer? She'd have the stomach for it, of that I'm sure.  	
FormID: 0002823A	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	At first I thought she was just a cranky old crone. Now I'm beginning to think she's a cold-blooded killer. 	
FormID: 0002823B	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	So you're telling me I should believe you? That Matilde is the killer? Why should I trust you? Get away from me!  	
FormID: 0002823C	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	I have no doubt that Matilde is capable of murder. But what about you? You're as much suspect in my eyes as she is.	
FormID: 0002823D	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	It's her, you understand me? It's Matilde! She's the killer! She's the one doing this! We've got to kill her first! Do you understand me? 	
FormID: 0002823E	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	I... I never trusted her. But I never wanted to see her dead. Have you no compassion at all? 	
FormID: 0002823F	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	It's hard to believe she's dead. Why would someone want to murder an old woman?	
FormID: 0002826F	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Good, I'm glad she's dead. I can tell you that because we're friends. Matilde didn't like me just because I'm a Dunmer. She got what she deserved.  	
FormID: 000286DF	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	The old woman? I'd put her in the same class as you, actually - a peasant.  	
FormID: 000286E0	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	The old woman? She's quite a pest, really. I think she's gotten it into her head that I need mothering, or something. She is sorely mistaken. 	
FormID: 000286E1	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Apparently the poor old woman thinks she is from a well-to-do family. Truth is, I have servants with more nobility in their blood than her. 	
FormID: 000286E2	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Is there something wrong with you? Someone has been murdered! My feelings about that old crone are hardly important right now! 	
FormID: 000286E3	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Something tells me the murder of one of the guests isn't going to stop Matilde from searching for the money. She strikes me as the greedy type.  	
FormID: 000286E4	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Now that someone's been killed, Matilde may be a little frightened for her own safety, but she's still more concerned with finding the hidden gold.	
FormID: 000286E4	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	1	Matilde claims to be from one of High Rock's most distinguished noble families, but I have a feeling their fortune has long been squandered.	
FormID: 000286E5	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	What are you doing? Trying to turn me against her? What's the matter, trying to cover your tracks? 	
FormID: 000286E6	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	She seems frightened, like the rest of us. I bet now she's regretting ever stepping foot in this house, gold or no.	
FormID: 000286E7	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	The more people that drop dead, the more annoying Matilde becomes. She keeps watching over me like some kind of worried grandmother. 	
FormID: 000286E7	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	1	If the killer strikes again, maybe they'll do me a favor and take her out next.    	
FormID: 000286E8	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	What, are you telling me Matilde is the killer? I don't know what to believe! You just stay away from me! 	
FormID: 000286E9	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	At first I thought Matilde was just a cloying old hag, but now I realize she could be the killer!	
FormID: 000286EA	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	It's her! Don't you see? She's the only one left! The only one left alive! We've got to get her before she can get us! Do you understand?  	
FormID: 000286EB	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	No, I didn't really care for her, you commoner scum, but I never wanted anything like this to happen to her!	
FormID: 000286EC	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	The old woman is dead! Murdered! Cut down in this very house! But why? Did she find the gold, and someone wanted it for their own?	
FormID: 00028716	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Between you and me, I think Matilde found the gold, and one of the others killed her for it! Maybe that means the rest of us are safe. 	
FormID: 00028716	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	1	If that's the case then the killer got what he was after, and the rest of us needn't worry about our own safety.  	
FormID: 00028729	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	I ain't got much to say about the old lady, and even if I did, I wouldn't say it to you.	
FormID: 0002872A	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Kind of stuck-up, that one. Right before you got here I told the funniest joke about an Argonian maid, and she didn't even crack a smile.	
FormID: 0002872B	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Heh, you should have seen the old biddy trying to talk to young Primo Antonius. She may be a noble, but he looked down on her like a scullery maid. 	
FormID: 0002872C	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Can't this wait, huh? Someone's been murdered and I've got better things to do than gossip about an old woman.	
FormID: 0002872D	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	The old biddy seems flustered about the murder, but who isn't, right?	
FormID: 0002872E	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	It seems she's upset about the murder, but there's something else. It's almost like she's glad there's less competition for the gold. Greedy old bat.	
FormID: 00028788	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Have you no compassion? There are two bloody corpses lying in this place, and all you can do is question me about that old woman?	
FormID: 00028789	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	She looks pretty shaken, doesn't she? I can't tell if it's genuine fear or just really good acting. She's as much a suspect as anyone, don't forget.	
FormID: 0002878A	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	I'll be honest, friend. I don't know what to think about Matilde. Yeah, she seems frightened, but she's also still alive. Why wasn't she killed?  	
FormID: 0002878A	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	1	She may look old and weak, but that's never stopped a murderer before, has it? Don't doubt for a second that she couldn't be the killer.	
FormID: 0002878B	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	What, you think the old woman is the killer, is that it? Is that what you'd have me believe? Trying to cover your tracks?	
FormID: 0002878C	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	She's either a frightened old woman or a cold-blooded killer! I don't know whether I should comfort her or hit her over the head with a rock!	
FormID: 0002878D	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	There are only three of us left! You and I are no killers, so that leaves the old woman! Don't be fooled by her appearance. Matilde is no weakling.	
FormID: 0002878D	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	1	She killed the others in cold blood, and she'll try to kill us next! I'm not about to stand around waiting to die! We need to kill Matilde!	
FormID: 0002878E	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	She's dead. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, now would you?	
FormID: 0002878F	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	What kind of sick, demented person could cut down an old woman in cold blood? It proves that evil truly does exist in this world.	
FormID: 00028790	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Some bloodthirsty monster killed that woman in cold blood. It's obvious to me one of the other guests killed her to eliminate the competition. 	
FormID: 00028790	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	1	Assuming that's true, who's next? You? Me? We need to keep our eyes open, friend. And we'd do well not to trust the others.	
FormID: 00028C23	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	What's your interest in the old woman? You'd do well to keep your questions to yourself.	
FormID: 00028C24	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Matilde seems like an upstanding citizen of the Empire. She respects the law and recognizes the Legion as Tamriel's greatest defense against evil.	
FormID: 00028C25	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	If I may be honest, I feel a bit sorry for the old woman. She comes from a noble family, I'm sure, but seems a lot less well off than she should be.	
FormID: 00028C26	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	She's upset, you idiot! Murder has that effect on people!	
FormID: 00028C27	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	The poor woman's rather upset. Someone of her bearing isn't accustomed to the horror of murder.	
FormID: 00028C28	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	She's afraid, and for good reason. If the killer strikes again, they may very well pick an easy target, like Matilde. She needn't worry, though.	
FormID: 00028C28	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	1	I'm a trained soldier with over twenty years experience dealing with situations like this. On my honor, this killer will be caught and dealt with!   	
FormID: 00028C2B	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Excuse me? You want to question me about Matilde? Two people have been murdered, you fool! Get your priorities straight!	
FormID: 00028C2C	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Matilde is old, and frail. The shock of two people being murdered is surely too much for the poor woman.	
FormID: 00028C2D	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	There's a killer in here and Matilde needs protection. Who better to defend her but me? I'm keeping my eye on the old woman, don't you worry.	
FormID: 00028C2E	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	I suppose you're trying to turn me against Matilde, eh? Make me think she's the killer. I've got news for you friend -- I know it's you!	
FormID: 00028C2E	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	1	I can't prove it yet, but just you wait. You try to hurt that poor old woman and I'll cut you in two!	
FormID: 00028C2F	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Three people have been killed, and now Matilde thinks she's next. I guess only the killer knows for sure. Isn't that right?	
FormID: 00028C30	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Three people have been killed, and the only ones left are you, me and a little old lady. One of us is a murderer, and my money's on the old lady. 	
FormID: 00028C30	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	1	Don't let her looks deceive you, friend. I've seen black widows like her before! Her crimes must not go unpunished! Justice is at hand!	
FormID: 00028C31	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Someone slaughtered that poor old woman like a lamb. I've got my eyes on you. Make one false move and I'll come down on you like a hammer.	
FormID: 00028C32	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	How could this happen? How could I have let my guard down. That poor old woman is dead, and I should have protected her....	
FormID: 00028C33	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	0	Matilde's murder saddens me friend, but not for the reason you may think. Ten years ago, when I was in my prime, this never would have happened.	
FormID: 00028C33	Dark08Whodunit	MatildePetitTopic	1	But now I'm old, and my instincts have failed. I let that woman down.	
FormID: 00027992	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	The little Dark Elf? She seems a nice enough girl. But to be perfectly honest, I've never trusted their kind.  	
FormID: 00028193	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	What about her? She's a Dark Elf, and that's bad enough. I may even like her less than you, if that's possible.   	
FormID: 00028194	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Personally, I think she's a little floozy. She's been eyeing young Primo Antonius, probably smells his wealth.	
FormID: 00028195	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Someone has been brutally murdered, yet you want to question me about that little Dark Elf tramp? Go away, you fool.	
FormID: 00028196	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	If you ask me, the Dark Elf is our killer. They're an evil and vengeful people, all of them. 	
FormID: 00028197	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	That little tramp is as guilty as sin, you hear me? She's the killer, and if we don't keep our eyes on her she'll do it again!	
FormID: 00028198	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	She's a Dark Elf and a harlot, and for all I know she's a murderer too! Now leave me be, you cretin!  	
FormID: 00028199	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Isn't it obvious? Two of us have been murdered in cold blood, and that little tramp hasn't batted an eyelash. You figure it out.	
FormID: 0002819A	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Don't trust her, sweetie. Not a thing she says. If she tries to get you alone anywhere, get away as fast as you can! She's a cold-blooded killer! 	
FormID: 0002819B	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	You bloody half-wit! Do I have to spell it out for you? She's a killer! A murderer! 	
FormID: 0002819C	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	I knew it! It's her! That Dark Elf tramp killed them all! We've got to get out of this place! 	
FormID: 0002819D	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	It's up to us now, don't you see? Dovesi did it! She murdered everyone! And now she wants to murder us too! We have to get her first! 	
FormID: 0002819E	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	So she's dead. What do you want from me? Flowers? A eulogy? I think not.	
FormID: 0002819F	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Yes, the poor girl is dead. What a shame. Well, I guess she won't be finding the gold, hmm? Hehehehehe.  	
FormID: 000281A0	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	One less Dark Elf in the world. And now there's one less person to find the gold, as well. It's a good day, don't you think?        	
FormID: 0002826E	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Not much to tell about me, really. I'm from Morrowind originally, but my family moved to Valenwood a few years ago.	
FormID: 00028705	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	My feelings toward her are really none of your business. 	
FormID: 00028706	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	She's quite beautiful, isn't she? A little young, perhaps, and not exactly high-born, but she possesses a unique elegance. 	
FormID: 00028707	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Can I be honest with you, my friend? I find Dovesi... captivating. She possesses a beauty beyond compare.	
FormID: 00028707	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	1	Maybe you could do me a favor? If you speak with her, put in a good word for me, would you? I would be forever in your debt.	
FormID: 00028708	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Do my ears deceive me, or are you actually suggesting Dovesi might be the one behind the murder? Back away now, cretin.  	
FormID: 00028709	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	She seems very upset by the murder. I do hope she'll be all right.  	
FormID: 0002870A	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	I can tell the murder is weighing heavily on her heart. She seems such a paradox to me. So gentle and beautiful, yet so strong...	
FormID: 0002870B	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	She's upset, you bufoon, just like the rest of us! Two people have been murdered! I hope you're not suggesting she could be the killer!	
FormID: 0002870C	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	The poor girl! She's too young, too innocent to be exposed to these horrible murders. I hope she's holding up all right.	
FormID: 0002870D	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	I don't mean to sound like a ghoul, but with two people murdered and Dovesi obviously upset, this may be my chance to get close to her. 	
FormID: 0002870D	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	1	You know, offer her comfort and support during this difficult time. Besides, I want to watch over her, make sure she stays safe.  	
FormID: 0002870E	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	You fiend! Are you suggesting Dovesi is the murderer? You'd do well to watch your mouth, and your back!  	
FormID: 0002870F	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Dovesi is young and weak, yet the killer left her alive. Why? She couldn't possibly have anything to do with the murders... could she?	
FormID: 00028710	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	How could I have been so naive, so stupid? We must stick together my friend, for Dovesi is surely the murderer! We must strike before she does! 	
FormID: 00028711	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	You're not even worthy enough to mention her name, you low-born parasite. Now get away from me before YOU wind up dead!	
FormID: 00028712	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	She was so beautiful. And now she's gone...	
FormID: 00028713	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Who? Who among us is vile enough to take the life of such a beautiful, precious creature? If I find out who did this, they will pay with their life!	
FormID: 0007096C	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	To think, I actually had feelings for that wretched witch! Thank the gods she's dead. Now... Now we're safe. We are safe... aren't we?	
FormID: 00028A05	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	She's an innocent young girl, and she doesn't need people like you asking questions about her. 	
FormID: 00028A06	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Dovesi is a sweet young lass. She reminds me of someone I knew. But perhaps we should talk about something else.	
FormID: 00028A07	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Let me confide something in you, my friend. Dovesi is the spitting image of my own daughter! Her skin is darker, of course, but that sweet face...	
FormID: 00028A07	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	1	My daughter was killed, you see. A few years back, by bandits. I'm sorry, please forgive a father's heavy heart.	
FormID: 00028A08	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	You want to talk to me about Dovesi? Someone's been murdered, you idiot! There are more important matters to discuss right now!	
FormID: 00028A09	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	The poor lass looks upset. But if she's anything like my daughter, she's tougher than she looks. She'll be all right.	
FormID: 00028A0A	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Let me tell you something. If anyone thinks they're going to hurt that poor Dark Elf girl, they're going to have to get through me first.	
FormID: 00028A0B	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Two people are dead, you pathetic little worm. Take your gossip mongering someplace else. 	
FormID: 00028A0C	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	She's frightened, of course. No one that young should be exposed to such horrors.	
FormID: 00028A0D	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	So far the killer has claimed two victims. If they plan on adding Dovesi to that list, they can think again. I won't let any harm come to that girl.	
FormID: 00028A0E	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Only three of us left, and one of us is a murderer. Do you expect me to believe it's that sweet girl? You murdering scum! I'll kill you!	
FormID: 00028A0F	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	She's afraid for her life, as we should be! There's someone else in this house, my friend. Someone hiding somewhere, killing us off one by one!	
FormID: 00028A10	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	I swear to you, my friend, if anyone tries to harm that sweet girl I will tear them limb from limb! Whoever killed the others will strike again.	
FormID: 00028A10	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	1	They're getting into this house somehow, which means there must be a way out as well! We need to find the secret exit and escape this madhouse!	
FormID: 00028A11	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Who could have done this? Who could have killed a sweet, innocent girl? Was it you? So help me, if I find out you're the one who did this....	
FormID: 00028A12	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	I..I can't believe she's dead. Seeing her body lying there.... It's like my poor daughter all over again.	
FormID: 00028A13	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	No... no! When I looked into Dovesi's face it was like peering at my own daughter. I... I feel like I've lost her all over again.	
FormID: 00028CDC	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	She's a Dark Elf. What, you blind as well as dumb?	
FormID: 00028CDD	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Dovesi is a Dark Elf. They call themselves Dunmer. When I was young, I spent some time stationed at Fort Moonmoth on their homeland of Morrowind.	
FormID: 00028CDD	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	1	I have a great respect for the Dunmer people. They are strong and noble, and generally understand the importance of law and discipline.	
FormID: 00028CDD	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	2	Unfortunately, Dovesi doesn't seem to like me very much. But I don't blame her. The young ones tend to have problems with authority figures.	
FormID: 00028CDE	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Ah yes, Dovesi Dran. She's a Dark Elf, originally from Morrowind, or so I hear. I get the sense she doesn't like me very much. 	
FormID: 00028CDF	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	I'm not sure I like your line of questioning, friend. Someone's been killed. Show a little respect.	
FormID: 00028CE0	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Dovesi's upset by the murder but she'll be okay. I get the sense she's seen worse things in her life.	
FormID: 00028CE1	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Right now my main concern is figuring out who the killer is. She may be young, but Dovesi is a suspect just like everyone else.	
FormID: 00028CE1	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	1	I've seen enough in my time to know that anyone is capable of murder if they have the right motivation.	
FormID: 00028CE2	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Why are you so concerned with my feelings toward a young Dark Elf girl? You wouldn't be so stupid as to try and turn me against her...	
FormID: 00028CE3	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	The girl's either upset that those people were killed or she's an excellent actress. She's still a suspect as far as I'm concerned.	
FormID: 00028CE4	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	You want my honest opinion? I think Nels is the killer. But I haven't yet ruled out that Dovesi may be working with him.	
FormID: 00028D31	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	You want to know the truth? I thought for sure Nels was the killer. But with him dead, my bets are now on Dovesi. 	
FormID: 00028D32	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	I find it odd that so many people have been killed, yet the two of you still live. Looks to me like you two are working together. 	
FormID: 00028D33	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	So, three of us left -- you, Dovesi and myself. The list of suspects is certainly getting smaller. With Nels dead, my eye is on Dovesi.	
FormID: 00028D34	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	You've helped me come to my senses, friend. There's no time for evidence gathering, no time to collect proof! Dovesi is the murderer!	
FormID: 00028D34	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	1	That little Dark Elf urchin killed three people in cold blood, and now she's going to try to kill us! We can't let that happen!	
FormID: 00028D34	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	2	Follow me, my friend, and watch my back. Dovesi must be brought to justice, and I'm the one to do it! Let's go!	
FormID: 00028D35	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	I would have sworn with my life that Nels was the killer, but now he's dead as well! Dovesi is now my top suspect.	
FormID: 00028D36	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	She was a child, and some sick murdering dog struck her down in cold blood. I swear, if I find out you did this I'll kill you with my bare hands.	
FormID: 00028D37	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	Dovesi couldn't have been any more than fifteen years old. What threat could she have posed? Why was she murdered? Damn it, I mean to find out!	
FormID: 00028D38	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	I was in the Legion for a great many years, my friend. I saw a lot of horrible things, including the murders of children.	
FormID: 00028D38	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	1	It made no sense then, it makes no sense now. But don't you worry. I vow to bring Dovesi's killer to justice!	
FormID: 0007096D	Dark08Whodunit	DovesiDranTopic	0	She murdered all those innocent people, and I delivered justice, just like any Legion soldier would. I... I only did what I thought was right...  	
FormID: 00027991	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	From what I gathered, he's a retired soldier. He's been all across the Empire fighting in various campaigns. Goodness, he's handsome....	
FormID: 00028169	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	What do you care? He seems like a very respectable person. That's more than I can say for you.	
FormID: 0002816A	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	Well, if I can be perfectly honest with you, I find Neville quite attractive. Redguards are so... exotic. Don't you think?	
FormID: 0002816B	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	What, you don't think Neville is the killer, do you? That's absurd! He's a gentleman and a retired soldier, not a murderer!	
FormID: 0002816C	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	Neville used to be a soldier. I'm sticking close to him. He makes me feel safe. 	
FormID: 0002816D	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	Neville has a strong sense of justice, I can tell. If we find out who the killer is, he'll take care of things, if you know what I mean. 	
FormID: 0002816E	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	You're trying to turn me against him, aren't you? Just leave me alone!	
FormID: 0002816F	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	I just don't know what to think anymore, or who to trust. Neville seems like such a decent man, but how can I know for sure?	
FormID: 00028170	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	Do... do you think he could have done it? I mean, he is a retired soldier. He's killed before. Oh, dear, this can't be happening!	
FormID: 00028171	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	You want me to mistrust him, don't you! You want to turn me against him! Maybe... maybe you're the murderer!	
FormID: 00028172	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	I'm no murderer, so that means it's either you or Neville. Just stay away from me! I don't trust either one of you!	
FormID: 00028173	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	I know you're no killer. That means it's Neville! Oh, I'm so frightened! Please protect me from him!	
FormID: 00028174	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	He's dead, and one of you killed him! I hate you all!	
FormID: 00028175	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	I... I can't believe he's dead. Such a strong, handsome man... 	
FormID: 00028176	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	Why would one of us kill Neville? What if they try to get the rest of us? You'll protect me, won't you? 	
FormID: 00028259	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	I really don't know anything about him, so you'd be better off asking someone else.  	
FormID: 0002825A	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	He's a very serious man, but I guess that's normal for a retired soldier. 	
FormID: 0002825B	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	I know he's a retired soldier. But not just a soldier -- he was an officer in the Imperial Legion. I hate the Legion and everything it stands for. 	
FormID: 0002825B	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	1	When those soldiers came to Morrowind, they persecuted my people and stole our lands.	
FormID: 0002825B	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	2	Neville may not be in the Legion anymore, but who knows what atrocities he committed.  	
FormID: 0002825C	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	I'm sorry, but someone has been murdered! I really don't want to talk about Neville right now.  	
FormID: 0002825D	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	Does being a soldier make him a good person? Does it make him above murder? I hardly think so.  	
FormID: 0002825E	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	I heard the others talking. Neville was a soldier for twenty years. He's used to killing, if you know what I'm saying.    	
FormID: 0002825F	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	Two people are dead. Could he really have done it? I... I just don't know... 	
FormID: 00028260	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	Two people have been murdered, and neither of them was Neville. Watch your back around him.  	
FormID: 00028261	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	Neville is a trained killer! That fascist pig killed those people, I just know it!  	
FormID: 00028262	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	He's the killer, you idiot! Can't you see? He murdered all of those people! 	
FormID: 00028263	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	He's the killer! Don't you see? We have to protect ourselves! We'll be next! 	
FormID: 00028264	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	He killed them! All of those people! We... we have to get him before he gets us! We have to kill that murdering swine! 	
FormID: 00028265	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	No, I didn't like the man. But why should you care? Please, just go away. 	
FormID: 00028266	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	I... I don't understand. Who would kill him? And why? Is this about the gold?  	
FormID: 0002826B	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	All right, so I didn't like Neville. But the man was a trained soldier. He knew how to handle himself. Who could possibly have killed him?    	
FormID: 000286F7	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	Why don't you go ask him yourself? Or maybe you're afraid? You should be.   	
FormID: 000286F8	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	He reminds me of the guards under my father's employ. Strict, no-nonsense, and ready to fight at a moment's notice.	
FormID: 000286F9	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	I know he's a retired Imperial Legion officer. Apparently, he's been in campaigns all across the Empire, from Skyrim to Morrowind. 	
FormID: 000286F9	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	1	I also get the sense that he's very eager to find the gold. I can't imagine his life of servitude to the Empire left him with much to retire on.	
FormID: 000286FA	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	What are you getting at? Are you suggesting that Neville is the killer? Take your suspicions someplace else, you low-born worm.  	
FormID: 000286FB	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	He seems on edge, doesn't he? I guess you can take the man out of the Legion, but you can never take the Legion out of the man.	
FormID: 000286FC	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	Neville seems different now that someone has been killed. More alert, more aware. Something tells me he's not going to take all of this lying down.	
FormID: 000286FC	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	1	He's a trained soldier, after all. I bet if anyone can figure out what's going on here, it will be him.	
FormID: 000286FD	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	Look, I don't know what kind of information you're after, but I won't help you. Just go away.  	
FormID: 000286FE	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	It seems that with each murder, Neville becomes that much more aware. If I didn't know better, I'd say he's planning on catching the killer himself.	
FormID: 000286FF	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	Well, Neville is a trained soldier. He was in the Imperial Legion for twenty years, or so I've heard. He certainly knows how to kill. 	
FormID: 000286FF	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	1	Still, I don't think he's the murderer. No, quite the contrary. I think he takes the murders personally, feels he should have protected the victims.	
FormID: 00028700	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	What are you saying? That Neville is the killer? Why should I trust a low-born dog like you? Get away from me!  	
FormID: 00028701	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	I... I thought he was hunting the killer. Now I don't know what to think! I don't trust him, or you! Stay away from me! 	
FormID: 00028702	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	I was wrong! Don't you see? I thought Neville was trying to catch the killer! But he IS the killer! We need to find a way out of here! 	
FormID: 00028703	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	He's dead, you peasant! There's nothing more to tell!  	
FormID: 00028704	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	Neville was strong, a soldier. If he was murdered, this does not bode well for the rest of us!  	
FormID: 00028714	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	My friend, I am truly worried! Neville was a strong and capable man, a soldier of twenty years! The rest of us will be easy prey for the killer now!	
FormID: 00028791	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	He's an Imperial Legion bulldog. Scum, if you ask me. Kind of like you.	
FormID: 00028792	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	Once an Imperial Legion bulldog, always an Imperial Legion bulldog. I've seen his kind before. He cares about laws and regulations... not people.	
FormID: 00028793	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	I will confide something in you, my friend. I despise Neville and all his Imperial Legion ilk! They are useless, uncaring tools of corruption!	
FormID: 00028793	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	1	Three years ago, my village in Skyrim was attacked by bandits. We went to the nearby Imperial Legion outpost, but they refused to help us!	
FormID: 00028793	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	2	My dear, sweet daughter Olga was killed that day. She was murdered, and the Legion would do nothing to help her. Neville and his kind are scum.	
FormID: 00028794	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	Right now I'm more concerned with the person who's been left for dead in this very house, not with that Legion dog.	
FormID: 00028795	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	He's like everyone else in the Imperial Legion. Someone needs help, someone is getting killed, and they're nowhere to be found. Worthless. 	
FormID: 00028796	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	I really have to wonder where Neville was when someone was getting slaughtered just a few rooms away. 	
FormID: 00028796	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	1	Maybe he was busy looking for the chest of gold. Or maybe he was right next to the victim, with his hand on the hilt of a dagger. Think about it.	
FormID: 00028797	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	By Ysmir's dragon blood, what's wrong with you? Two people are dead! It's hardly the time to chat about that Legion lackey!	
FormID: 00028798	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	Two of us killed, and where was the stalwart Legionnaire? That's what I'd like to know. He spent his life protecting the citizens of Tamriel? Ha!	
FormID: 00028799	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	0	With two of us now dead, it seems like the others are looking to Neville for protection. The fools! He'll kill them like he did the others!	
FormID: 00028799	Dark08Whodunit	NevilleTopic	1	That's right, I think Neville is the murderer. I can't prove it yet, but he'll slip up, just you wait. Whatever you do, don't turn your back on him.

FormID: 00028A30	EmfridDEMO	EmfridDEMOchoice3	0	I knew it! I knew a man like Bittneld wouldn't be interested in those other women! 	
FormID: 00028A30	EmfridDEMO	EmfridDEMOchoice3	1	Ha! They parade around in their fancy clothes and their expensive perfumes. What do they know? All fluff and no fiber. That's what I say.	
FormID: 00028A30	EmfridDEMO	EmfridDEMOchoice3	2	But...what if we're wrong? Bittneld has traveled the world, while I've spent my whole life in this tavern.	
FormID: 00028A30	EmfridDEMO	EmfridDEMOchoice3	3	No matter. Will you ask him to visit me? I would be most grateful.	
FormID: 00028A2F	EmfridDEMO	EmfridDEMOchoice2	0	You've spoken with him? Really? What did he say? I beg you, tell me.	
FormID: 00028A2E	EmfridDEMO	EmfridDEMOChoice1	0	You haven't? Why not? Is this just a game to you?	
FormID: 00028A2E	EmfridDEMO	EmfridDEMOChoice1	1	I'm sorry. Please. Just come back to me when you've spoken to Bittneld.	
FormID: 00028BA6	MS16B	MS16Choice7B	0	Then why do you waste my time? Begone, I have no more patience for you today.	
FormID: 00028C7B	MS16B	MS16Choice7B	0	Well then, you must excuse me. I have important business to attend to.	
FormID: 00028BA7	MS16B	MS16Choice7A	0	Yes, yes! This is indeed the Honorblade of Chorrol, finally delivered back to us after all these years!	
FormID: 00028BA7	MS16B	MS16Choice7A	1	So this tale has a happy ending after all, at least for you. Money cannot buy happiness, they say, but we know better.	
FormID: 00028C7A	MS16B	MS16Choice7A	0	This is incredible! I never thought to see this sword again! How did you ... never mind, one should not look a gift horse in the mouth.	
FormID: 00028C7A	MS16B	MS16Choice7A	1	Please accept my thanks on behalf of the people of Chorrol, for restoring this sword and the honor of our city.	
FormID: 00028C7A	MS16B	MS16Choice7A	2	As a token of our gratitude, I bestow upon you a symbol of honor and heroism, the Escutcheon of Chorrol.	
FormID: 00028C7A	MS16B	MS16Choice7A	3	You've done a great service to Chorrol, and you should be proud.	
FormID: 00028AC7	MS16B	MS16BStolenItem	0	Many years ago, when the Count was still alive, a daring thief stole the ancient Honorblade of Chorrol from out of this castle. Why?	
FormID: 00028C79	MS16B	MS16BStolenItem	0	You have it? Let me see it!	
FormID: 00028BA5	MS16B	MS16BStolenItem	0	I do not care to describe it. You will know it when you see it, I think. It is not something one of the ogres should have in his possession.	
FormID: 00028AC9	MS16B	MS16Choice6A	0	Indeed. What is the point of my tale? Albert Jemane builds Weatherleah way out in the middle of nowhere.	
FormID: 00028AC9	MS16B	MS16Choice6A	1	He was a thief, not a farmer. The only reason to establish such a place would be to stay out of the Chorrol Guard's sight.	
FormID: 00028AC9	MS16B	MS16Choice6A	2	I believe that the item Albert stole, which rightly belongs to me, was hidden at the Weatherleah settlement.	
FormID: 00028AC9	MS16B	MS16Choice6A	3	Unfortunately, the notorious Redguard Valley Ogres ransacked the place and probably took all of the loot back with them.	
FormID: 00028AC9	MS16B	MS16Choice6A	4	If you were to obtain this item, somehow, and bring it to me, I would pay you very well for it.	
FormID: 00028AC9	MS16B	MS16Choice6A	5	I can get you started by telling you where the Ogres live. The rest is up to you.	
FormID: 00028B85	MS16B	MS16Choice5B	0	Suit yourself. I thought you might have an interest in self-improvement, but perhaps not. Let me know if you ever change your mind.	
FormID: 00028AC8	MS16B	MS16Choice5A	0	Excellent. Curiosity should never be denied, is it not so? And who knows, my story may prove profitable to both of us once it has come to its end.	
FormID: 00028AC8	MS16B	MS16Choice5A	1	My tale actually begins with the father, Albert Jemane. He was once in my employ, or should I say the employ of my organization.	
FormID: 00028AC8	MS16B	MS16Choice5A	2	He was very good at obtaining things from people who did not want to part with. A professional thief, to put it bluntly.	
FormID: 00028AC8	MS16B	MS16Choice5A	3	He was assigned to obtain a very valuable item for me. He succeeded, but decided to keep this item for himself. An unfortunate decision.	
FormID: 00028AC8	MS16B	MS16Choice5A	4	He fled from Chorrol with his family, and was never heard from again. Only his small son Reynald was found, wandering alone in the wilderness.	
FormID: 00028AC8	MS16B	MS16Choice5A	5	Naturally, my associates and I believed he had perished. The wilderness is, after all, a dangerous place. No place to take your family.	
FormID: 00028AC8	MS16B	MS16Choice5A	6	Then, these many years later, voila! The brother reappears. It seems the rest of the family did not die in the wilderness after all.	
FormID: 00028C0C	MG05A	MG05AChoice2B	0	Is that so?	
FormID: 00028C0C	MG05A	MG05AChoice2B	1	Bah. I was a fool to have trusted you in the first place. Get out of my sight.	
FormID: 00028C0D	MG05A	MG05AChoice2A	0	Of course you will. Do whatever you must; I require that book as soon as possible.	
FormID: 00028C07	MG05A	MG05AChoice1A	0	WHAT?	
FormID: 00028C07	MG05A	MG05AChoice1A	1	You gave HIM the book? What were you thinking? And here I thought one of you Guild mages might actually have a brain...	
FormID: 00028C07	MG05A	MG05AChoice1A	2	All right, all right. We can deal with this. You'll have to get it back, that's all.	
FormID: 00028C07	MG05A	MG05AChoice1A	3	You're in the guild, aren't you? You should be able to walk right in, find it, and take it. And if you can't, then break in. I want that book.	
FormID: 00028C07	MG05A	MG05AChoice1A	4	Bring it to me once you have it. I'll even still give you the reward I promised, despite your incompetence. Now go!	REC
FormID: 00028C09	MG05A	MG05AChoice1A	0	You did WHAT?	
FormID: 00028C09	MG05A	MG05AChoice1A	1	Are you out of your mind? Did I not make it clear that Teekeeus was the one person I NEVER wanted to acquire that book?	
FormID: 00028C09	MG05A	MG05AChoice1A	2	I can't believe you could be so stupid...	
FormID: 00028C09	MG05A	MG05AChoice1A	3	All right. No need to get angry, I suppose. It's a small problem, but one that you can resolve.	REC
FormID: 00028C09	MG05A	MG05AChoice1A	4	You'll just have to get the book back, that's all. Whatever it takes, yes? If you need to break in and steal it, that's what you'll do.	
FormID: 00028C09	MG05A	MG05AChoice1A	5	At least, you will if you want your reward. Now get moving!	
FormID: 0001DC27	MS38FIN	GlarthirTopic	0	Sad story. But at least we stopped him in time, thanks to you.	
FormID: 0002365D	MS38FIN	GlarthirTopic	0	Hadn't you heard? He went crazy and killed Bernadette Peneles, poor girl.	
FormID: 00029AA4	MS38FIN	GlarthirTopic	0	It's unbelievable. Glarthir went after Toutius Sextius with an axe. Killed him before the guards could do anything. No one even knows why.	
FormID: 00029AA5	MS38FIN	GlarthirTopic	0	You must not have heard. He went crazy and killed Davide Surilie with an axe! Nobody can figure out why.	
FormID: 00029A71	MS38FIN	GlarthirTopic	0	It's too bad nobody stopped Glarthir before he went on his killing spree. I guess no one knew how crazy he really was.	
FormID: 00029AA7	MS38FIN	GlarthirTopic	0	Did you hear? He went crazy and started attacking people with an axe! Luckily the guards stopped him before he killed anyone.	
FormID: 0002A86E	MS38FIN	GlarthirTopic	0	He turned up dead. I guess someone finally got tired of his crazy behavior.	
FormID: 0002A86F	MS38FIN	GlarthirTopic	0	The town eccentric. Lives in the big house on the corner, southwest of the Chapel. Don't worry, he's harmless.	
FormID: 00023667	MS38	GlarthirTopic	0	Don't worry about him. We'll handle it.	
FormID: 00028D64	MS38	GlarthirTopic	0	How to say this nicely?  He's sort of the town eccentric.  Lived here for years, we've gotten used to his ways.	
FormID: 00028D64	MS38	GlarthirTopic	1	Although ... lately he's been weirder than usual.  Always looking over his shoulder, writing in his little notebook.  I wonder what he's up to now.	
FormID: 00028D67	MS38	GlarthirTopic	0	He's a raving lunatic.  I'm assuming you're asking because he's done something strange.	
FormID: 00028D67	MS38	GlarthirTopic	1	Like what?  Oh, like shouting obscenties at you, or wearing only fur for an entire year, or waiting outside your house every morning.	
FormID: 00028D67	MS38	GlarthirTopic	2	Not that you'll get anyone else in town to admit it. [QUOTE]Oh, he's harmless, we're used to him.[QUOTE] Harmless, ha!  One day he'll snap. Then watch out.	
FormID: 00028D69	MS38	GlarthirTopic	0	I'm sorry, but I don't think I know any Glarthir.  Wait, do you mean that strange Wood Elf that you see wandering around the city?	
FormID: 00028D69	MS38	GlarthirTopic	1	Yes, I've seen him, but never spoken to him.  He seems to be at the Low Gate every morning when I pass by on my way to the castle.	
FormID: 00028D69	MS38	GlarthirTopic	2	Gives me the strangest looks, now that you mention it.  Almost like he hates me, although I have no idea why.	
FormID: 0002365E	MS38	GlarthirTopic	0	Thank you for warning me about him. Please, hurry and tell the guards before it's too late!	
FormID: 0002365F	MS38	GlarthirTopic	0	I appreciate your warning. I'll be on the lookout for him. But please tell the guards so they can arrest him before he attacks me!	
FormID: 00023660	MS38	GlarthirTopic	0	You did the right thing showing us that note. My brother and I will take care of him, don't worry.	
FormID: 00028D6A	MS38	GlarthirTopic	0	You look concerned. Is there something you want to tell me about Glarthir?	
FormID: 00023661	MS38	GlarthirTopic	0	What of him?	
FormID: 00023662	MS38	GlarthirTopic	0	Our neighbor. A bit eccentric. Why, is there something I should know?	
FormID: 00023663	MS38	GlarthirTopic	0	Yes, the strange Wood Elf who haunts the Low Gate every morning, you said he was Glarthir.  I'm afraid I know nothing else about the fellow.	
FormID: 00028D6C	MS38	GlarthirTopic	0	Well, I know he's a bit odd, but I've always thought he was kind of sweet.  Lately, though, he has been stranger than usual.	
FormID: 00028D6C	MS38	GlarthirTopic	1	I think maybe he's been following me.  I see him every morning on my way to Chapel.  I've tried to say hello but he always pretends not to hear me.	
FormID: 00028D6D	MS38	GlarthirTopic	0	You may have heard that he's a bit touched in the head, and that may be true, but he's always been a quiet neighbor.  Never given us any trouble.	
FormID: 0002365C	MS38	GlarthirTopic	0	You have something you want to tell me about that nutcase?	
FormID: 00028D86	MS38	GlarthirTopic	0	Glarthir?  Total nutcase, if you ask me.  But he's never done anything -- yet -- that we could arrest him for.	
FormID: 00028D6E	MS38	GlarthirTopic	0	I don't mean to gossip, but he is more than a bit strange.  However, he's always been tolerated as the town eccentric.

FormID: 00028D70	MS38	MS38Topic	0	Yes, I heard Bernadette Peneles say that she thought he was following her. It might finally be time to do something about that crazy Wood Elf.

FormID: 00024E1C	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	Rena and I moved to Chorrol so we could have a nice, comfortable home for our dogs. It's a lovely town. And our dogs are so happy here.	
FormID: 00024E1D	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	They probably call us 'the Dog People' here in town. Rimalus and I love dogs. We have quite a few. So sweet and well-behaved, you wouldn't believe.	
FormID: 00024E11	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	You need a place to sleep in Chorrol? Well, why don't you just join the Fighters Guild, or Mages Guild? Sleep for free around Cyrodiil!	
FormID: 00024E13	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	It's good that you've joined one of our local organizations. It helps you make the right connections.	
FormID: 00024E12	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	If you're thinking of making Chorrol your home, you should join a guild. It's hard work, but steady money. And people get to know you.	
FormID: 0002C4D3	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	We're simple, Gods-fearing folk here in County Chorrol. Easterners worship their wallets and their fat bellies.	
FormID: 000C48AB	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	Are you a student of the Arcane Arts? My husband, Alberic, is an Advanced Trainer in Conjuration at the Mages Guild.	REC - [error - missed becauseo f missing faction]
FormID: 0002C4D4	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	Chorrol's got plenty to eat, and good, thick walls, and that suits me fine. I don't know what's going on out there in the woods, and I don't need to.	
FormID: 0002A371	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	Yeah. I used to be Fighters Guild here in Chorrol, but I done some incarceration for Trespassing and Theft. Couple of times.	
FormID: 0002A371	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	1	You know, they kick you out of the guild if you get caught doing some incarceration. How many? I forget. But I did a lot.	
FormID: 0002A69E	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	The Oak and Crosier is the place of choice for well-bred visitors to Chorrol. The Grey Mare is more suitable for... others.	
FormID: 0002A6A7	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	I'm not from Chorrol. I'm afraid I can't tell you anything at all about the town.	
FormID: 000237BA	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	Chorrol? That's where we are, right? Really? Great. I don't care. And I'm not interested. But it's sure nice of you to let me know.	
FormID: 000237CE	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	I've never been here before. And I won't be back, unless the boss wants me here.	
FormID: 000237E9	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	If I don't have what you need, you might try the other Chorrol merchants. Renoit's has books. Fire and Steel for your armor and weapons.	
FormID: 0002396E	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	Nice town. But you need money here to live well. Head out of town and do some hunting. Sell the skins. Or, you can loot old caves and ruins.	
FormID: 00023CCE	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	There are a lot of fine-looking women in Chorrol. But they're all... kind of snooty. And not very nice.

FormID: 00024E03	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	You can PAY for a bed at the Grey Mare or the Oak and Crosier. But if you get a bed for free at a guild, why would you pay for one?	
FormID: 00024E14	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	Smart thing is to join a guild. Any guild. Gets you a place to sleep for free.  No muss, no fuss, no crummy tavern food and lice-ridden beds.	
FormID: 00024F30	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	I'm sorry. I'm new in town, and don't know anyone.	
FormID: 00024F3D	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	I hear that Emfrid and Captain Bittneld are spending a lot of time together. You wouldn't have anything to do with that, would you?	
FormID: 00024F46	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	Who is the fairest of them all? Other than myself? The proprietor of the Grey Mare is lovely. She and the guard captain would be a nice couple....	
FormID: 0002A691	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	In Chorrol, we don't think much about what goes on in the Imperial Palace. But these murders... the emperor and all his sons dead... what's next?	
FormID: 0004E8DE	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	The deer here are skittish. Need to get them quick, or they'll lead you a merry chase. Poison on your arrows can help, and it won't hurt the meat.	
FormID: 00023995	NQDChorrol	ChorrolTopic	0	We're a mountain people, tough, independent. County Chorrol is rich in mines and timber, wool and mutton, and hard-working people.	
FormID: 00023972	NQDWilderness	ChorrolTopic	0	In Chorrol, we don't trust people we don't know. But if you're respectable -- if you hang with respectable people -- we're not so unfriendly. 	
FormID: 0002A361	NQDWilderness	ChorrolTopic	0	You joined the Mages Guild? Excellent. Good people. Substantial.	
FormID: 0002A367	NQDWilderness	ChorrolTopic	0	You joined the Fighters Guild? Very good. Hard-working, trustworthy folk.	
FormID: 0002A36B	NQDWilderness	ChorrolTopic	0	I'm glad you took my advice. Have you noticed how people are more friendly, now you're established in the community?	
FormID: 0002A693	NQDWilderness	ChorrolTopic	0	It's like I said. Join the guilds or the Chapel. In Chorrol, we like what we know.

FormID: 0000C220	ArenaDialogue	ArenaChoice2B	0	A Light Raiment, huh? You sure? I figured you for the Heavy Raiment type. You know, hide behind a skin of steel? Hmph. Okay then, here.	REC -- The [QUOTE]hmph[QUOTE] should be more like he's surprised (thinking to himself). The [QUOTE]Okay then, here[QUOTE] was read to quickly.
FormID: 0000C220	ArenaDialogue	ArenaChoice2B	1	Put that on, see if it fits okay. When you're ready for a match, I'll be waiting. You want to fight, you talk to me. All right then.	
FormID: 0000C1B7	ArenaDialogue	ArenaChoice2A	0	Here. Wear it proudly. And keep it in good condition, would you? That way I can give it to some other suicidal idiot after you're dead.	
FormID: 0000C1B7	ArenaDialogue	ArenaChoice2A	1	Just let me know when you're ready for a match and we can get this over with.	
FormID: 0001C0E3	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	Listen, I can't let you fight in a match while you've got a bet down on another combatant. Put your gambling to bed, and then we'll talk!	
FormID: 000BE425	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	You can't fight now! You have a bet down on an Arena match. Look, finish up with our gambling, and then you can fight.	
FormID: 0001C284	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	Okay Brawler, you know the drill. Head up to that Arena and show 'em who's boss!	
FormID: 0002B1E2	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	All right, this is it. Your last fight against the Yellow Team. I guess you could say they saved the best for last. The three best, actually.	
FormID: 0002B1E2	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	1	You're up against a swordsman, an archer and a spellcaster. Two lower level combatants, plus that Yellow Team Champion you've seen down here.	
FormID: 0002B1E2	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	2	You beat all three, and you get named Champion! I know you can do this! Now get up there and show everyone why you're the best!	
FormID: 0002B1E2	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	3	Oh wait, there's one more thing! I sent Porkchop the boar up to the Arena to help you out. He'll at least keep one of them distracted! Now good luck!	
FormID: 0000C167	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	You must be downright determined to get yourself killed, huh? Okay then, head back up to the Arena and try not to die before the gate opens.	
FormID: 0000C0E6	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	Ha ha! Now that's the spirit! You give the people of Cyrodiil a good show, and I'll make sure you get a decent burial! Ha ha ha ha ha!	
FormID: 000182CC	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	All right, Brawler, this next match is going to be a challenge. Turns out there are two Wood Elf sisters who always fight together.              	
FormID: 000182CC	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	1	They're twins, actually. You got to take 'em both out! Now get in there, and show those tree climbers who's boss!	
FormID: 000182C6	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	Your next opponent is a Khajiit. Not one of the quick, jumpy ones either. This cat goes in heavy, usually with an axe! Now go get 'em!	
FormID: 000182C0	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	This next opponent is a Redguard. I've seen him fight with both a mace and a sword, so be ready for either one.	
FormID: 000182B4	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	Next up is a Dark Elf. I've never seen him fight before, but he's got a bow as well as a sword, so be ready for a ranged attack!	
FormID: 000182AE	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	Don't be fooled by your next opponent. The little dagger he uses is actually a powerful enchanted weapon called Shimmerstrike. Now go get 'em! 	
FormID: 000182A8	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	No surprises with this next one, just a High Elf with a chip on her shoulder. Get up to that Arena and make her beg for death!	
FormID: 000182A2	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	This next opponent is your standard axe-armed Orc. He's in a Heavy Raiment, and looks pretty fit. Nothin' you can't handle.	
FormID: 0001829C	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	I've seen this next one fight before. She's a Nord, very quick, very strong. She favors a longsword and knows how to use it. Don't underestimate her.	
FormID: 00018290	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	Your next opponent is the most savage, blood-crazed Orc I've ever seen, and believe me I've seen a lot of 'em! This will not be fun!	
FormID: 00018290	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	1	She'll come out of that gate with a warhammer the size of a child, and she'll swing it until your head explodes! Don't let that happen!	
FormID: 0002B1E7	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	Listen up! This next match is an outrage, but there's nothin' I can do about it! You've got three opponents this time, and you have to beat them all!	
FormID: 0002B1E7	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	1	They're Argonian prisoners, brought here from Black Marsh. They've been told they have to kill you in exchange for their freedom!                  	
FormID: 0002B1E7	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	2	I don't know what crimes they commited, but it's your life or their freedom! The choice should be pretty clear! Get going, and watch yourself!	
FormID: 0002B1E6	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	After that last match, this one should feel like a vacation. One Khajiit in a Heavy Raiment, probably with a sword. Nothin' you can't handle.	
FormID: 0002B1E5	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	This next one's a Breton. He looks like a bit of a dandy, but he's deadly with a blade. He has more experience than you, so be prepared.	
FormID: 0002B1E4	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	The first Yellow Team Hero you'll face is an Imperial in Heavy Raiment. He fights with an Akaviri longsword.	
FormID: 0002B1E4	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	1	Thing is, this guy used to be a Blade. You know, those guys who protect the Emperor? He's a trained swordsman, so keep your damn head down!	
FormID: 0002B1E3	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	Okay, Hero. This next opponent is a High Elf wizard, a master in the school of Destruction. But wait, it gets worse...	
FormID: 0002B1E3	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	1	He also uses an enchanted shield called the Gray Aegis, which gives him some serious magic resistances. Your best bet is to just charge straight in!	
FormID: 0002B1E3	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	2	Press the attack, and don't give him a chance to let off a spell! I don't want to have to sweep your ashes out of the Arena!	
FormID: 0000C0D0	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	All right, maggot. Looks like you're suited up in your Battle Raiment and all set to go. The Red Room is just over there.	
FormID: 0000C0D0	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	1	When you're ready to get eviscerated, just head up the ramp to the Arena. Good luck, and may Azura have mercy on your soul. 	
FormID: 000182B9	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	Your next opponent wears a Heavy Raiment, but attacks with a short sword. She's like a heavily-armored wasp, and has the temper to match. Careful.   	
FormID: 00018293	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	Ugh, spellcasters. That's what this next one is, a High Elf sorceress or something. Just get in close and stab her a few times, that'll teach her.	
FormID: 00022D9F	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	Ready? Ready for what? You're Grand Champion! You've already won it all! The whole damn thing! Ha ha ha ha ha!	
FormID: 00022DA0	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	Ready? Ready for what? You're a champion now! The Grand Championship is the only thing left!  	
FormID: 0000C1E6	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	Ready? You call that ready? You're not even wearing your Battle Raiment! Don't talk to me again until you're suited up, you disrespectful maggot!	
FormID: 0000C1FA	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	I know you're ready! I already approved your match, you idiot! Now get up to that Arena and spill some blood!	
FormID: 0001C28A	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	You're a Bloodletter now, so your opponents aren't gonna hold back anymore! This is the real deal! Get into that Arena and make the Yellow Team pay!	
FormID: 0001C0E9	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	The match is all set, my friend! Now get up to that Arena and teach those Yellow Team maggots some manners!	
FormID: 0001C290	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	Um... You're not wearing your Battle Raiment... You all right? You haven't taken too many blows to the head, have you?	
FormID: 0001C296	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	I know, I know! Sometimes I wish we'd run the matches through the night, too! But the Yellow Team needs their beauty sleep! Ha ha ha ha!	
FormID: 0001C27E	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	You might be ready, but the Arena ain't. Matches take place between 9:00 AM and 9:00 PM. Come back later, moron.	
FormID: 00037FFE	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	So you're ready to fight the Gray Prince, are you? Well you can't go out there without a name. You know, an Arena name!  	
FormID: 00037FFE	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	1	Something catchy, something the people of Cyrodiil will remember when they tell stories about your inglorious defeat! So, what's it going to be?	
FormID: 00037FFF	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	So you're ready to fight the Gray Prince, are you? Well you can't go out there without a name. You know, an Arena name!  	
FormID: 00037FFF	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	1	Something catchy, something the people of Cyrodiil will remember when they tell stories about your inglorious defeat! So, what's it going to be?	
FormID: 00038B36	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	You'd damn well better be ready! You've got an Arena full of people and the Grand Champion himself waiting for you! Now get up there and fight!	
FormID: 0003D7B3	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	You're ready to fight? Good, good! All right then, head up to the Arena and give the people a great show!  	
FormID: 0003D7B5	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	Yeah, I know, you already told me. That's why there's an Arena full of Spectators and some hungry creature that wants to make you its lunch! 	
FormID: 0003D7B6	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	We're just not ready! It takes time to find those beasties and get them back here alive. Remember, just one show a week. Come back some other day.	
FormID: 0002C338	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	Okay, based on your abilities, here are your choices. Do you want to fight one Boar, one Boar and one Wolf, or two Wolves and one Goblin Skirmisher? 	
FormID: 0002C33D	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	Okay, based on your abilities, here are your choices. Do you want to fight one Goblin Berserker, two Trolls, or two Goblin Berserkers and one Troll?

FormID: 0002C35B	ArenaDialogue	ReadyForAMatch	0	Looks like you've reached your peak. Tell you what, from here on in, you can fight one, two or three Minotaur Lords. So what's it going to be?       	
FormID: 00029CA8	ArenaDialogue	RulesOfCompetition	0	You fight for the Blue Team. You fight against the Yellow Team. In order to fight in the Arena you must wear an Arena Battle Raiment.   	
FormID: 00029CA8	ArenaDialogue	RulesOfCompetition	1	The Battle Raiment covers your entire body. You can use your own helmet, shield, and weapon, so choose those items wisely.	
FormID: 00029CA8	ArenaDialogue	RulesOfCompetition	2	The Battle Raiment's already enchanted, so you can't muck with it. But aside from that, anything goes. Magic, stealth... whatever you need to win. 	
FormID: 00029CA8	ArenaDialogue	RulesOfCompetition	3	You can compete in the Arena any day from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM. Just come to me, tell me you're ready for a match, and away you'll go. Got it? Good.	
FormID: 00029CA8	ArenaDialogue	RulesOfCompetition	4	If you actually manage to win a fight, don't get any ideas about looting your opponent's corpse! That's strictly forbidden!	
FormID: 00038B37	ArenaDialogue	RulesOfCompetition	0	Okay, listen up. There are no disqualifications in a Grand Champion match. That means you can wear whatever armor you damn well please.	
FormID: 00038B37	ArenaDialogue	RulesOfCompetition	1	Agronak will be wearing his Raiment of Valor, and he's probably got it heavily enchanted, so feel free to do the same to any armor you have.	REC
FormID: 00038B37	ArenaDialogue	RulesOfCompetition	2	Now, as you know, in any standard Arena match you're forbidden from looting the corpse of a fallen opponent. Well this ain't any standard match.  	
FormID: 00038B37	ArenaDialogue	RulesOfCompetition	3	In the event that you beat the Gray Prince, you're to remove his armor and present it to me. Then you'll get your own Raiment of Valor.        	REC
FormID: 0003D7B4	ArenaDialogue	RulesOfCompetition	0	Look, these aren't your average Arena matches. They're shows! You fighting some savage beasts! People come to see you kill things. It's simple.

FormID: 0003D7B4	ArenaDialogue	RulesOfCompetition	2	You can wear whatever ever you want, of course. We don't want you getting killed out there!	
FormID: 0003D7B4	ArenaDialogue	RulesOfCompetition	3	You can only fight once a week, though. We'll need that much time to catch new creatures for you to fight against.	
FormID: 0003D7B4	ArenaDialogue	RulesOfCompetition	4	Oh, and don't worry. We'll try to match the creatures to your combat abilities, so the fights will always be more or less [QUOTE]fair.[QUOTE] Sounds good, huh?	
FormID: 0003D7B4	ArenaDialogue	RulesOfCompetition	5	We'll do it like this. You can fight one, two, or three creatures. The more creatures you fight, the more you win. If you survive, that is! Ha ha ha!	
FormID: 00029CA7	ArenaDialogue	ArenaChoice1B	0	You're damn right you will! This is a training hall, not a nursery! Now get back up those stairs while you still have legs! Damned tourists....

FormID: 00029FD4	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDResponses	0	No question about it. And Seed-Neeus is an excellent proprietor.	
FormID: 00029FD5	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDResponses	0	Not a bad idea if you're looking for work.

FormID: 00029FD8	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDResponses	0	I haven't really spent any time around him. I find him a little frightening, actually.	
FormID: 00029FD9	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDResponses	0	I've heard there are good trainers there. Costs a bit of coin, though. I'd rather go out and practice on my own.	
FormID: 00029FDA	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDResponses	0	It's not always easy to find a good trainer. That's a good place to look.

FormID: 00029FDC	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDResponses	0	I've never spent time at the Mages Guild. I've thought about it, though.

FormID: 00029FDF	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDResponses	0	I like dogs, but it's a bit excessive with those two folks.

FormID: 00029FE1	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDResponses	0	Can't say I've heard anything myself. Still, that's odd.	
FormID: 00029FE2	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDResponses	0	Strange noises, you say? How very odd. I haven't heard it myself.	
FormID: 00029FE3	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDResponses	0	Strange noises? They should have the guards look into that.	
FormID: 00029FE4	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDResponses	0	I've liked some of Scribonia's work. Haven't read everything, though.	
FormID: 00029FE5	NQDChorrol	ChorrolNQDResponses	0	I'd like to read Scribonia's work. I just wish I had more time to do it.

FormID: 0002D775	NQDKvatchNPC	KvatchTopic	2	But I'll be here. This is my town. Nothing is driving me out of here.	
FormID: 0002D930	NQDKvatchNPC	KvatchTopic	0	I really can't tell you what happened. I'm just lucky to be alive.	
FormID: 0002D930	NQDKvatchNPC	KvatchTopic	1	I was in my basement. Suddenly there was a lot of noise and heat.	
FormID: 0002D930	NQDKvatchNPC	KvatchTopic	2	I stepped outside, and the whole town was on fire, smoke everywhere. I ran for the gate.	
FormID: 0002D930	NQDKvatchNPC	KvatchTopic	3	I got through the gate, and kept running through the woods by the light of the fires.	
FormID: 0002D930	NQDKvatchNPC	KvatchTopic	4	I slept in the woods. I came back in the morning, and Kvatch was gone.	
FormID: 0002D930	NQDKvatchNPC	KvatchTopic	5	There was nothing I could do. I just ran. If I hadn't, I'd be dead.

FormID: 000039D5	NQDKvatchNPC	KvatchTopic	0	A gate opened and daedra poured out. Everybody ran. Or they died.	
FormID: 000039D5	NQDKvatchNPC	KvatchTopic	1	I don't know how the fire started, but it burned Kvatch to the ground.	
FormID: 000039D6	NQDKvatchNPC	KvatchTopic	0	I don't like to talk about it. I don't remember much.	
FormID: 000039D6	NQDKvatchNPC	KvatchTopic	1	I woke to screaming and fire. I ran.	
FormID: 000039D6	NQDKvatchNPC	KvatchTopic	2	I was lucky. I survived. My friends weren't so lucky.	
FormID: 000039D7	NQDKvatchNPC	KvatchTopic	0	Go look for yourself. The town is gone. And most of its people.	
FormID: 000039D7	NQDKvatchNPC	KvatchTopic	1	The Daedra came out of the gate in the middle of the night.

FormID: 000A944D	MS22Fin	UmbacanoTopic	0	I never suspected Umbacano might be up to no good. Apparently he was as mad as he was rich!

FormID: 000A4964	NQDImperialCity	UmbacanoTopic	0	I'm sorry, but my master is not receiving visitors at this hour. If you come back in the morning, I'm sure he would be glad to see you.

FormID: 000A9849	NQDImperialCity	UmbacanoTopic	0	I got no complaints. Kind of an arrogant bastard if you get right down to it, but he pays us well enough.	
FormID: 000A984A	NQDImperialCity	UmbacanoTopic	0	I am one of his guard dogs, no more, no less. He pays us well to guard his many treasures. This is enough for me.

FormID: 0002AE28	EmfridDEMO	EronorDEMO1	0	Undoubtedly. There's hardly a cloud in the sky.

FormID: 0002AE29	EmfridDEMO	PinerDEMO1	0	Well, I must be going. Take care.	
FormID: 0002AE2A	EmfridDEMO	PinerDEMO1	0	I spoke to him yesterday. He seems rather concerned about those boys of his.

FormID: 0002C525	MS22	ClaudeMaricTopic	0	You are cautious and perceptive. Good traits to have in this business. Yes, you guess correctly. This one is working for Maric.	
FormID: 0002C525	MS22	ClaudeMaricTopic	1	He never tells us anything, though. Just between the two of us, this one thinks Maric is cheating him. In fact, this one is sure of it.	
FormID: 0002C525	MS22	ClaudeMaricTopic	2	Listen. S'razirr has an idea of how we can both come out of this ahead.	
FormID: 0002C52B	MS22	ClaudeMaricTopic	0	The original offer is still on the table: this one helps you against Maric in return for half your take. What do you say?	
FormID: 000A4960	MS22	ClaudeMaricTopic	0	I kept my side of our bargain. Make sure you keep yours.	
FormID: 0002C52C	MS22	ClaudeMaricTopic	0	Don't worry, this one will back you up when the time comes.	
FormID: 0002C817	MS22	ClaudeMaricTopic	0	I believe a little friendly competition always sharpens the wits. Even more reason for you to get back to hunting for my carving.	
FormID: 0002C814	MS22Fin	ClaudeMaricTopic	0	My methods were vindicated. Apparently Maric was more capable than you. I'm sure you will try harder the next time.	
FormID: 0002C815	MS22Fin	ClaudeMaricTopic	0	I hope you don't blame me for the unpleasantness with Maric. I have no control over the man. In any case, it all turned out well, didn't it?	
FormID: 0002B09F	MS22	MaladaTopic	0	Must I hold your hand? I begin to wonder what Umbacano sees in you. It is an Ayleid ruin in the far west of this province, up in the Valus Mountains.	
FormID: 0002C52D	MS22	MaladaTopic	0	Beautiful countryside, don't you think? We're just doing a bit of hunting and sightseeing, not that it's any of your business.	
FormID: 0002C52E	MS22	MaladaTopic	0	Strange ruins, huh? You'd have to be crazy to go in there. I'm just here for the scenery and fresh air.	
FormID: 0002C52A	MS22	MaladaTopic	0	You're probably wondering what this one is doing in this gods-forsaken wilderness. Same here. S'razirr doesn't get paid nearly enough for this.	
FormID: 0002C521	MS22Fin	MaladaTopic	0	An unfortunate encounter for both of us. But as I said, it was only business. No hard feelings, I hope.	
FormID: 0002C523	MS22Fin	MaladaTopic	0	You showed admirable prudence. I was not half so sensible at your age, ha ha ha! Not to worry, I'm sure you will get the drop on me one day!	
FormID: 0002AF39	MS22	MS22NoCarving	0	Then I don't understand why you are still here in the Imperial City. You should return to Malada and retrieve the carving!	
FormID: 0002AF38	MS22	MS22GiveCarving	0	Wonderful! You are indeed a treasure hunter of exceptional talents! Here is your reward as promised!	
FormID: 0002AF38	MS22	MS22GiveCarving	1	Normally I would give you a chance to celebrate your success, but I do have another task for you, if you are interested. A rather urgent one.	
FormID: 0002C51B	MS22	MS22GiveCarving	0	You will go far in this business, my friend. You know when you've won, and when you've lost. Until we meet again!	
FormID: 0002C819	MS22	MS22HighFane	0	My interest was in recovering the carving from Malada, and Maric has already delivered it to me.	
FormID: 0002C819	MS22	MS22HighFane	1	Our arrangement was clear. I would pay you for delivering me the carving. Since Maric delivered the carving, he earned the reward.	
FormID: 0002C819	MS22	MS22HighFane	2	I thank you for your efforts, but I am sure you understand that I cannot pay you for a task that you did not complete.	
FormID: 0002C819	MS22	MS22HighFane	3	However, I do have another task, a rather urgent one in fact, if you would like to redeem yourself.	
FormID: 0002AF37	MS22	MS22HighFane	0	Yes, you learned that it is the ruin now known as Malada. Were you able to recover the carving yet?	
FormID: 0002AF36	MS22	MS22HighFane	0	Your first task is to locate the ruins of the High Fane. I believe it must now be known by a different name.	
FormID: 0002C728	MS22	MS22HighFane	0	Shouldn't you be off to Malada to retrieve the carving I want?	
FormID: 0002AF35	MS22Fin	MS22HighFane	0	The carving you recovered from Malada will be invaluable in my research on the Late Ayleid Period.	
FormID: 0002C818	MS22Fin	MS22HighFane	0	I'm sorry you were not able to fulfill your part of our agreement, but I consider the matter closed. Please do not speak of it again.	
FormID: 0002AF34	MS22	MS22Mission	0	The High Fane dates from the Late Ayleid Period, following the fall of White Gold Tower, a very troubled time for that ancient people.	
FormID: 0002AF34	MS22	MS22Mission	1	A time I find most fascinating. The drawing on the bottom of the page I gave you depicts a carved panel from the central chamber of the High Fane.	
FormID: 0002AF34	MS22	MS22Mission	2	I believe this carving will shed new light on Ayleid history, if I am able to examine it closely. I would like you to retrieve it for me.	
FormID: 0002AF34	MS22	MS22Mission	3	You will need this as well. It is the key to the inner chamber of the High Fane.	
FormID: 0002AF34	MS22	MS22Mission	4	I part with it reluctantly, so guard it well. It is what began my search for the High Fane, many years ago.	
FormID: 0002AF33	MS22	MS22DontKnowHighFane	0	I'm not surprised. I have not been able to find any modern reference to it.	
FormID: 0002AF33	MS22	MS22DontKnowHighFane	1	Still, the architectural detail is distinctive enough, it may still be recognizable.	
FormID: 0002AF32	MS22	MS22KnowHighFane	0	Malada? Really? I confess, I had never made the connection. But, yes... it makes sense...	
FormID: 0002AF32	MS22	MS22KnowHighFane	1	In any event, this should make your job easier than I had feared.	
FormID: 0002AF30	MS21	MS21NotInterested	0	Very well. Perhaps I misjudged you after all.	
FormID: 0002AF2F	MS21	MS21Interested	0	Excellent. Here, take a look at this sketch. The ancient texts refer to this site only as [QUOTE]The High Fane.[QUOTE] Do you know it?	
FormID: 000A657C	MS27	MS21AnotherTask	0	This is not quite in your usual line of work, but I hope you can help me just the same.	
FormID: 000A657C	MS27	MS21AnotherTask	1	A rival collector has an item which I very much want to add to my collection. But she stubbornly refuses to consider any of my offers.	
FormID: 000A657C	MS27	MS21AnotherTask	2	She and I have had our differences over the years, I admit. Now she is taking this opportunity to get her revenge.	
FormID: 000A657C	MS27	MS21AnotherTask	3	I believe that you may be able to persuade her to part with the item, where I cannot due to her prejudice against me. Are you interested?	
FormID: 000A657D	MS27	MS21AnotherTask	0	As I said, I believe I have something that will interest you. More in your usual line of work. And, of course, your reward will be generous.	
FormID: 000A657E	MS27	MS21AnotherTask	0	Have you reconsidered? Will you help me reach the Throne Room of Nenalata?	
FormID: 000A9348	MS27	MS21AnotherTask	0	Have you reconsidered? Will you help me reach the Throne Room of Nenalata?	
FormID: 0002AF2E	MS21	MS21AnotherTask	0	You have proven yourself more than a simple grave robber. I believe you can handle a more complicated assignment. Are you interested?	
FormID: 000272D5	MS18	MS18OdiilTalk04	0	Defend yourselves! Here they come!	Shout it as if in battle.
FormID: 0002B463	MS21	MS21StatueGive	0	You have exceeded my fondest hopes, my friend. The Ten Ancestors are reunited at last! This is truly an historic day!	
FormID: 0002B463	MS21	MS21StatueGive	1	As I promised when we first met, here is your reward for completing the set. Take it with my sincere thanks. It is well-deserved.	
FormID: 0002B51F	MS21	MS21StatueGive	0	You are doing very well in your treasure hunt, my friend. Only one more statue remains to be discovered!	
FormID: 0002B51F	MS21	MS21StatueGive	1	You are very close to earning the reward for completing the set of ten. I urge you to redouble your efforts!	
FormID: 0002B5E8	MS21	MS21StatueGive	0	I had never thought to see eight of the Ancestors together again in my lifetime. Well done!	
FormID: 0002B5E9	MS21	MS21StatueGive	0	I am impressed. Only three more statues to complete the set. Keep up the good work, my friend.	
FormID: 0002B522	MS21	MS21StatueGive	0	Beautiful. Exquisite. You have proven yourself to be quite resourceful. I have another task which should interest someone of your particular talents.	
FormID: 0002B525	MS21	MS21StatueGive	0	Ah, a second Ancestor. Excellent. I had wondered whether the first was just luck, but I see now that you have some skill at this work.	
FormID: 0002B525	MS21	MS21StatueGive	1	By good fortune, my research has uncovered some new information that may help you in your search for the remaining statues.	
FormID: 0002B527	MS21	MS21StatueGive	0	Well done! Here is your payment as promised.	
FormID: 000844C3	MS21	MS21StatueGive	0	Wonderful! Remember, I will be happy to give you the same price for any others that you find.	
FormID: 000844C3	MS21	MS21StatueGive	1	And I'll double your payment if you manage to recover the complete set of ten. I look forward to a long and mutually profitable relationship.	
FormID: 0002B464	MS21	MS21StatueNo	0	Well then, you have work to do. I will continue to search the archives for any clues to the statues' locations.	
FormID: 0002B5ED	MS21	MS21StatueNo	0	Well then, you have work to do. You'd best be on your way.	
FormID: 0002B460	MS21	MS21TempleOfAncestors	0	You know it as White Gold Tower -- the center of the ancient Ayleid capital of Nibenay. 	
FormID: 0002B460	MS21	MS21TempleOfAncestors	1	It was brutally sacked thousands of years ago by humans led by Alessia. The Imperial City is built over the ruins of that ancient city.	
FormID: 0002B45F	MS21	MS21AyleidStatueTopic	0	You were more resourceful than I had hoped. I esteem you greatly for your success in bringing the Ten Ancestors together again after all these years.	
FormID: 0002B43E	MS21	MS21AyleidStatueTopic	0	I am looking for the complete set of ten for my collection. They were once part of the Temple of the Ancestors in the ancient Ayleid capital.	
FormID: 0002B43E	MS21	MS21AyleidStatueTopic	1	Through my research, I have learned that they were removed from the temple before its sack by Men.	
FormID: 0002B43E	MS21	MS21AyleidStatueTopic	2	I believe they were hidden in various Ayleid settlements across Cyrodiil, although I do not know the exact location of any of them.	
FormID: 0002B43E	MS21	MS21AyleidStatueTopic	3	Why, have you already found another statue for me?

FormID: 0002B43F	MS21	MS21AyleidStatueTopic	0	Yes? Have you found another statue for me?	
FormID: 0002B45D	MS21	MS21Special	0	Ah, the treasure hunter. Please, have a seat.	
FormID: 00085995	MS21	MS21Special	0	What can I do for you?	
FormID: 0002B526	MS21	MS21StatueClue	0	I have found the names of a number of Ayleid cities where the statues may have been taken for safekeeping during the siege of White Gold Tower.	
FormID: 0002B526	MS21	MS21StatueClue	1	The only modern sites that still bear their ancient names are Moranda, Mackamentain, Wenyandawik, Ninendava, and Fanacas.	
FormID: 0002B526	MS21	MS21StatueClue	2	There is no guarantee that my sources are correct, of course, but these should at least provide a starting point for your search.

FormID: 0002C0D0	MG03Illusion	MG03Choice2B	0	Are you sure? Well, all right. I can't give you a better offer.	
FormID: 0002C0F0	MG03Illusion	MG03Choice2A	0	I'll just take the money from you then. And here's your staff. Now, since our business is concluded, you must excuse me. Good day.	
FormID: 0002C0F1	MG03Illusion	MG03Choice2A	0	I'll just take the money from you then... what, you don't have it?	
FormID: 0002C0F1	MG03Illusion	MG03Choice2A	1	I don't see how we can do business if you don't have the gold for it.

FormID: 0002C6C1	DAAzura	DAAzuraSpeech	0	I have seen your name, Traveler, and heard it whispered in twilight. I ask a service, which holds promise of fame and reward.	The voice of god... formal and lofty, but respectful, and asking a favor.
FormID: 0002C6C2	DAAzura	DAAzuraSpeech	0	Many years ago, five followers slew the vampire Dratik and its kin, but all were infected by the foul creature.	The voice of god... formal and lofty, but respectful, and asking a favor.
FormID: 0002C6C3	DAAzura	DAAzuraSpeech	0	Knowing their fate, they sealed themselves up in the vampire's lair. Their suffering weighs heavily on me. 	The voice of god... compassion and regret for their fate
FormID: 0002C6C4	DAAzura	DAAzuraSpeech	0	Travel to the Gutted Mine. The door will open to you. Bring the peace of death to my followers, and you shall earn my gratitude.	The voice of god... firm resolve, promise of reward
FormID: 0002C6C5	DAAzura	DAAzuraSpeech	0	Thank you, mortal. Their spirits are free, and henceforth, above my shrine, five bright candles shall burn forever in memory of their sacrifice. 	The voice of god... gratitude, increased respect
FormID: 0002C6C6	DAAzura	DAAzuraSpeech	0	For your service, take this token, that your deeds might be entered in the Book of Fate.	The voice of god... obscure hint of prophesied future fame and glory
FormID: 00031C97	MS13	MS13StaffofIndarys	0	The Staff of Indarys it is. Again, I thank you on behalf of all the citizens of Cheydinhal, and I especially thank you as an elated father.	
FormID: 00031C97	MS13	MS13StaffofIndarys	1	Farewell, and may Arkay guide you.	
FormID: 00031C96	MS13	MS13ThornbladeTopic	0	The Thornblade it is. Again, I thank you on behalf of all the citizens of Cheydinhal, and I especially thank you as an elated father.	
FormID: 00031C96	MS13	MS13ThornbladeTopic	1	Farewell, and may Arkay guide you.	
FormID: 00031C95	MS13	MS13FarwilSlain	0	Then it's a sad day in Cheydinhal. The Knights were boastful louts, but they didn't deserve to be killed.	
FormID: 00031C95	MS13	MS13FarwilSlain	1	I'll stay here and do a final sweep of the area. You're to report to the Count directly, as he wishes to speak with you.	
FormID: 00031C87	MS13	MS13GetOut	0	Are you mad? A Knight of the Thorn never returns home until the mission is done. It's our way.	
FormID: 00031C87	MS13	MS13GetOut	1	Now, in my father's name as Count Indarys of Cheydinhal, I order you to lead me to that sigil stone!	
FormID: 00031C87	MS13	MS13GetOut	2	I suggest we use the Reman Sweep Formation. You'll assault and we'll guard the rear flank. Onward and upward! Huzzah!	
FormID: 00031C84	MS13	MS13KnightsWhy	0	It's tolerated because Farwil is the Count's son. Plain and simple. He has the power and the coin to put it all together.	
FormID: 00031C84	MS13	MS13KnightsWhy	1	Most of the time, they lounge around the tavern drinking and making up stories of epic battles with impossible odds that they won.	
FormID: 00031C84	MS13	MS13KnightsWhy	2	It's all garbage. They never patrol, they never help fight off the ocassional bandit that slips into the city. Ah well. I've said too much already.	
FormID: 00031840	MS13	KnightsofThorn	0	As a Knight of the Thorn, you are now expected to carry this symbol of your knighthood. Carry it proudly and wear it well.	
FormID: 000C452C	MS13	KnightsofThorn	0	We are Knights sworn to uphold the laws of Cheydinhal. We fear no being, and we strike fast and true as lightning.	
FormID: 000C452C	MS13	KnightsofThorn	1	Many wish to join our ranks, as we are of the highest echelon. Only a select few may join the finest force ever to grace the lands of Cyrodiil.	
FormID: 000C452C	MS13	KnightsofThorn	2	Until now, we numbered only seven, but attacked like a regiment. Our enemies quake at our approach, and falter at our charge. Huzzah!	
FormID: 000335A5	MS13	KnightsofThorn	0	It's a shame so many of the Knights fell. I suppose their intentions were good, even if they were a bit self-serving.	
FormID: 00031B75	MS13	KnightsofThorn	0	There are seven of them including Farwil. Even though they're a nuisance, I still hope they haven't been hurt... or worse.	
FormID: 00031C83	MS13	KnightsofThorn	0	New to these parts, eh?	
FormID: 00031C83	MS13	KnightsofThorn	1	The Knights of the Thorn are a bunch of rabble who fancy themselves true knights. Farwil formed the group around two years ago.	
FormID: 00031C83	MS13	KnightsofThorn	2	They make grand boasts, and talk a good talk, but that's all they are. The real work goes to us, the City Guard.	
FormID: 00031C83	MS13	KnightsofThorn	3	I hate to speak ill of them, as something horrible may have happened, but their own bravado got them into this mess.	
FormID: 000314E9	MSFIN	KnightsofThorn	0	There are no quests for you right now, sir knight. Don't fret, though. The Knights will rise to the occasion once again! Huzzah!	
FormID: 00031EBB	MSFIN	KnightsofThorn	0	I'm saddened by the loss of those brave souls. May Arkay guide all of them to their final rest.	
FormID: 00031EBE	MSFIN	KnightsofThorn	0	I think if you'd had the chance to speak to any of the knights, they were happy to follow Farwil into battle.	
FormID: 00031EBE	MSFIN	KnightsofThorn	1	I'll be having a very long talk with my impetuous son. I don't blame him directly for their deaths, but he must learn to do things the proper way.	
FormID: 00031EBE	MSFIN	KnightsofThorn	2	He must realize he'll be ruling Cheydinhal one day. That's a responsibility I aim to make him ready for.	
FormID: 000C452A	MS13Alt	KnightsofThorn	0	Yes, I am a member of the Knights of the Thorn. Or what's left of them anyway.	
FormID: 000C452A	MS13Alt	KnightsofThorn	1	If you want to hear the tale, I suggest you talk to Farwil, our commander.	
FormID: 000C452D	MS13Alt	KnightsofThorn	0	There may be only three of us left, but we still can match blades with the best of them.	
FormID: 00031842	MS13Alt	KnightsofThorn	0	We are Knights sworn to uphold the laws of Cheydinhal. We fear no being, and we strike fast and true as lightning.	
FormID: 00031842	MS13Alt	KnightsofThorn	1	Many wish to join our ranks, as we are of the highest echelon. Only a select few may join the finest force ever to grace the lands of Cyrodiil.	
FormID: 00031842	MS13Alt	KnightsofThorn	2	Until now, we numbered only seven, but attacked like a regiment. Our enemies quake at our approach, and falter at our charge. Huzzah!	
FormID: 0002C529	MS22	MS22SrazirrNoDeal	0	Suit yourself. Maric may be cheating S'razirr, but at least this one knows what to expect.	
FormID: 0002C527	MS22	MS22SrazirrNegotiate	0	But this one is taking all of the risk! What do you have to lose? One fourth, that's S'razirr's final offer.	
FormID: 0002C528	MS22	MS22SrazirrAgreed	0	You won't regret it. This one will keep his eyes open, and wait for an opportunity to help you.	
FormID: 0002C528	MS22	MS22SrazirrAgreed	1	Don't screw this one, though. After the dust settles, look for S'razirr in the Tiber Septim Inn in the Imperial City. Full payment is expected.	
FormID: 0002C526	MS22	MS22SrazirrGoAhead	0	We wait and see how this plays out. If and when there's an opportunity, S'razirr will help you against Maric.	
FormID: 0002C526	MS22	MS22SrazirrGoAhead	1	If we succeed in recovering the treasure, you give this one half of what you're getting paid.	
FormID: 0002C51C	MS22	MS22Refuse	0	Are you sure? I truly have no wish to harm you. It is the carving I want. Just business.	
FormID: 0002C51C	MS22	MS22Refuse	1	Hand it over, and some day we will both laugh about this over drinks at the Tiber Septim. I will give you one last chance.	
FormID: 0002C51D	MS22	MS22Refuse	0	As you wish. Too bad, I was just getting to like you. Kill him.	
FormID: 0002C5B5	FGD05Oreyn	BlackheartsRing	0	You've got it. Good. I'll use it to prove it was we, not the Blackwood Company, who killed him. Good work on this.	
FormID: 0002C5B5	FGD05Oreyn	BlackheartsRing	1	Now, get out of here. I'm going to head back to Chorrol. When there's more to do, I'll let you know.	REC
FormID: 0002C674	FGD05Oreyn	BlackheartsRing	0	Get the ring for me. We'll need it as proof.	
FormID: 0002C622	FGD05Oreyn	FGD05Choice9	0	We find Blackheart and get that weapon. We'll finish this contract and let all of Cyrodiil know what happened here.	
FormID: 0002C622	FGD05Oreyn	FGD05Choice9	1	Blackheart has a fascination with these Ayleid ruins. There's one northeast of here, Atatar. My bet is that he moved his base there. I'll lead.	
FormID: 0002C651	FGD05Oreyn	FGD05Choice8	0	Come back when you're ready. Don't delay.	
FormID: 0002C639	FGD05Oreyn	FGD05Choice7	0	Good. Let's go.	
FormID: 0002C5C1	FGD05Oreyn	FGD05Choice6	0	Get back to me when you change your mind.	
FormID: 0002C5C3	FGD05Oreyn	FGD05Choice6	0	I'm sorry to hear that. Sooner or later, the contracts are going to dry up. Maybe then you'll reconsider.	
FormID: 0002C5C0	FGD05Oreyn	FGD05Choice5	0	We leave as soon as you're ready. I want to investigate Blackheart's stronghold at Arpenia. Meet me at the Leyawiin guild hall. We'll go from there.	
FormID: 0002C5BF	FGD04Defector	FGD04Choice3	0	They weren't always a threat. Small scale mercenary band, until Ri'Zakar took over. Then came the fat Imperial contracts.	
FormID: 0002C5BF	FGD04Defector	FGD04Choice3	1	After a mission in Black Marsh, they set up shop in Leyawiin. More ruthless than ever. It needs investigating. First, though, you need advancement.	REC
FormID: 0002C5BE	FGD05Oreyn	FGD05Choice4	0	Now we find out what really happened. And we let it be known. I want to show the people who the Blackwood Company really are.	
FormID: 0002C5BE	FGD05Oreyn	FGD05Choice4	1	I can't order you do this with me. It's dangerous, and Vilena isn't going to know about it. It's your choice.	
FormID: 0002C5BD	FGD05Oreyn	FGD05Choice3	0	I snooped around. Apparently, they completed that contract for us. I went in there with twenty good men. I can't believe that bunch finished the job.	
FormID: 0002C5BD	FGD05Oreyn	FGD05Choice3	1	There's more. Argoth -- he's dead, the artifact gone. Sounds like a set-up. Maybe they made a deal with Blackheart. I don't know. But I'll find out.	
FormID: 0002C5BC	FGD05Oreyn	FGD05Choice2	0	Vilena's gotten tentative since the Blackheart mission. She's worried about getting us killed. But we're just getting killed a little bit at a time.	REC
FormID: 0002C5BB	FGD05Oreyn	FGD05Choice1	0	Good question. I've heard stories, but nothing I can prove is true. Maybe they've got a mage working with them. Maybe they're just well trained.	
FormID: 0002C5BB	FGD05Oreyn	FGD05Choice1	1	All I know for sure is that they'll accept any contract, and they'll do anything to complete it. And they don't care who gets in the way.	
FormID: 0002C6EB	MS05	MS05PreparedNo	0	Alright. Please, come back soon. I'll wait for you here.	
FormID: 0002C6EA	MS05	MS05PreparedYes	0	Please, use the extra bed here. If you sleep too far from Henantier, it may not work. I'll watch over you both to make sure you're safe.	
FormID: 0002C6EA	MS05	MS05PreparedYes	1	Oh my! I almost forgot!	
FormID: 0002C6EA	MS05	MS05PreparedYes	2	Henantier once told me that if he's killed in his dreams, anyone that's in there with him will die as well. So, do be careful.	
FormID: 0002C6DF	MS05	MS05WhyMe	0	I fear that anyone he knows won't be able to help him in there. Since I'm in his memories, he may dismiss me as a figment of his dreams.	
FormID: 0002C6DF	MS05	MS05WhyMe	1	The only chance is for a total stranger to enter his dreams.	
FormID: 0002C6DF	MS05	MS05WhyMe	2	When you're ready to do this, I'll give you the amulet. Only I know the secret way it can be removed from his neck.	
FormID: 0002C6DE	MS05	MS05Dreams	0	True, but this is different. When you enter your dreams with the amulet, you're in full command of a dream-like replica of yourself.	
FormID: 0002C6DE	MS05	MS05Dreams	1	All your thoughts, your skills and your talents travel there with you. Think of it as exploring a new land, but a land within your own mind.	
FormID: 0002C6DE	MS05	MS05Dreams	2	Henantier created the amulet to see if he could use his dreams as a training ground to help better himself.	
FormID: 0002C6DE	MS05	MS05Dreams	3	I don't know all of the details, but the amulet is a conduit to get to that training ground.	
FormID: 0002C6DE	MS05	MS05Dreams	4	It's been three days, and he's been stuck in his dreams. I've watched him all that time, and he hasn't been up at all.	
FormID: 0002C6DE	MS05	MS05Dreams	5	The only way to save him is to put on the Dreamworld Amulet and go to sleep. Only then can you hopefully find out what's happened in there.	
FormID: 0002C6D0	MS05	MS05DreamworldTopic	0	But... how? What you say must be the truth... I feel strange...	
FormID: 0002C6D0	MS05	MS05DreamworldTopic	1	I can see now what you were saying was no story at all, but the truth, and I'm a fool. I had no idea that the amulet could hold such power over me.	
FormID: 0002C6D0	MS05	MS05DreamworldTopic	2	I set out to create a way to conquer my failings, but it seems the tables had turned, and they conquered me.	
FormID: 0002C6D0	MS05	MS05DreamworldTopic	3	I don't know how you did it, but I thank you. Now, we must wake from this dream and take our places in the real world again. Farewell.	
FormID: 0002C6D1	MS05	MS05DreamworldTopic	0	Elements? Inside a dream? Bah! That's the most foolish thing I've ever heard! Get away from me... you're clearly insane!	
FormID: 0002C6D5	MS05	MS05DreamworldTopic	0	This place is so strange. Dreamworld, you say? It's more like a nightmare. I don't like this place at all. I feel like I shouldn't be here.	
FormID: 0002C6D5	MS05	MS05DreamworldTopic	1	There must be an exit around here somewhere. I'd explore this place, but I'm afraid I just don't have the courage to do so.	
FormID: 0002C6D5	MS05	MS05DreamworldTopic	2	How could I be so careless? What's the matter with me?	Very angry.
FormID: 0002C6D5	MS05	MS05DreamworldTopic	3	I know I've lost something. Yes, that's it. I've lost many things in this strange place. Would you please help me?	
FormID: 0003CD5F	MS05	MS05DreamworldTopic	0	I wish to never speak of the Dreamworld again. Henantier's free of its grip, and I can't bear a reminder he was ever a prisoner in that dark place.	
FormID: 0002C6D9	MS05	MS05DreamworldTopic	0	You'll have to be very careful in there. If Henantier intended it as a training ground, there's no telling what you may encounter.	
FormID: 0002C6DD	MS05	MS05DreamworldTopic	0	I told him that trying to travel into one's own dreams is risky. But as usual, he didn't listen to me. Always has to do things his way.	
FormID: 0002C6DD	MS05	MS05DreamworldTopic	1	Henantier constructed a magical device he called the Dreamworld Amulet. With this device, one can enter his own mind and experience dreams.	
FormID: 0002C6DC	MS05	MS05PleaseExplain	0	Henantier isn't a prisoner in any physical sense. He's a prisoner of his own mind. He's trapped in his Dreamworld.	
FormID: 0002C6DB	MS05	MS05WhatGives	0	You must learn to broaden your thoughts and hold your tongue! Allow me to explain before jumping to conclusions!	
FormID: 0002C6DB	MS05	MS05WhatGives	1	Henantier isn't a prisoner in any physical sense. He's a prisoner of his own mind. He's trapped in his Dreamworld.	
FormID: 0002C7CB	FGD02DandD	FGD02Choice3	0	Report us? Oh, no. Why, we might never get work from the guild again! And that would be different how, exactly?	
FormID: 0002C7CA	FGD02DandD	FGD02Choice2	0	A brilliant idea! Oreyn only sends his best these days. Tell you what. You go find us some paying work, and we'll happily go about it.	REC[CRLF];oh-RAIN
FormID: 0002C7BA	FGD02DandD	FGD02Choice1	0	Oh? We must? Well, last I saw, you didn't outrank me, Protector. I suggest you mind your manners... and your own business.	
FormID: 0002C7BC	FGD02DandD	FGD02Choice1	0	Oh? We must? Well, last I saw, you didn't outrank me, Swordsman. I suggest you mind your manners... and your own business.

FormID: 0002C822	MS22Fin	MS22SrazirrNotEnough2	0	You are no better than that renrij Maric. S'razirr should have known better than to trust you. Get out of this one's sight.	
FormID: 0002C81F	MS22Fin	MS22SrazirrNotEnough	0	That is not the right answer. S'razirr knows you have been paid by Umbacano. Oh yes, this one has listened much since we met at Malada.	
FormID: 0002C81F	MS22Fin	MS22SrazirrNotEnough	1	S'razirr will not be cheated again. The question is asked again: will you pay what was promised?	
FormID: 0002C824	MS22Fin	MS22SrazirrScrew	0	You are no better than that renrij Maric. S'razirr should have known better than to trust you. Get out of this one's sight.	
FormID: 0002C820	MS22Fin	MS22SrazirrPay	0	You are honorable. Unlike that renrij Maric, may the moons never shine upon his path. This one will not forget.	
FormID: 0002C81A	MS22	MS22MaricCarving	0	I'm sorry to hear that. Especially since Maric has not delivered the carving either.	
FormID: 0002C81A	MS22	MS22MaricCarving	1	Let me be clear: whoever delivers the carving will receive the reward. All I care about is the carving.	
FormID: 0002B09C	MS22	MS22MaricHighFane	0	You know what? I will help you, although it is liable to get you killed. The High Fane is now known as Malada, up in the Valus Mountains.	
FormID: 0002B09C	MS22	MS22MaricHighFane	1	But I do not advise you to go there. Read [QUOTE]The Cleansing of the Fane[QUOTE] first. Then decide. As I said, a very bad place.	
FormID: 00086746	MS22	MS22MaricHighFane	0	What would be the sport in me just telling you? I'm not that drunk yet! No, you must earn your pay.

FormID: 00031039	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	0	Bring me Jeanne's Manual of Spellcraft, and then we'll talk about helping you find J'skar.	REC
FormID: 000302D3	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	0	You want to find J'skar? 	
FormID: 000302D3	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	1	All right, I think I can help with that. But you have to agree to do something for me, first.	
FormID: 000302D3	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	2	And whatever you do, you can't tell Jeanne about it. All right?	
FormID: 0005E1DA	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	0	I've already told you, I'm not helping unless you agree to do something for me. Do we have a deal, or not?	
FormID: 0002D586	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	0	Oh, I might know where he is, I suppose.	
FormID: 0002D586	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	1	I'm afraid I don't trust you enough to talk about it, though. You are working for Jeanne, after all.	
FormID: 0002D587	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	0	Hmm? Oh, Jeanne has you looking for him, does she?	
FormID: 0002D587	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	1	I'm afraid you're not going to find him easily. I think a, uh, spell backfired. That's probably it.	
FormID: 0002D58A	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	0	Look, I don't know you very well. Why would I help you?	
FormID: 0002D58A	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	1	He's invisible, and you've about as much luck finding him as Jeanne does. Excuse me.	
FormID: 0002D58B	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	0	Look, I like you and all, but I really don't want to get in the middle of this.	
FormID: 0002D58B	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	1	If Volanaro and J'skar want to have their fun, fine. I'm not going to participate, and I'm not saying another word about it. Take it up with them.	
FormID: 0001CEF2	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	0	I haven't seen him in days. Volanaro said something about a spell backfiring, making him permanently invisible.	
FormID: 0001CEF2	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	1	Maybe you should go see him about it. I don't feel like talking about it with you.	REC
FormID: 0003103C	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	0	Found him, did you? Well, I suppose that's good.	
FormID: 0003103C	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	1	You'll have to forgive me... I seem to have misplaced something. Hmm. Yes, well, let's nevermind that.	REC[CRLF]confused; dismissive
FormID: 0003103C	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	2	You've fulfilled your end of the bargain, though, so I'll fulfill mine. Raminus will have my recommendation.

FormID: 0002D591	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	0	He's disappeared.	
FormID: 0002D591	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	1	I mean he's really disappeared. No one here has seen him in days. Volanaro thinks maybe a spell backfired.	
FormID: 0002D591	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	2	If someone from the Council were to stop by, and find him gone, it'd look bad for me. I can't have that.	
FormID: 0002D591	MG06Bruma	JskarTopic	3	Talk to the mages here, and see what you can find out. If you can make J'skar re-appear, you'll have your recommendation.	
FormID: 0000A100	MG14Plot	JskarTopic	0	He was the only one left?	
FormID: 0000A100	MG14Plot	JskarTopic	1	This is worse than I thought.	
FormID: 0000A100	MG14Plot	JskarTopic	2	From what he's told you, Mannimarco -- the King of Worms -- is here in Cyrodiil, and preying on our Guild. This is something I'd never have dreamed.

FormID: 0002D061	MG00Join	jointheMagesGuild	0	Well, no bounty on your head, and you look able enough. Very well; are you sure you want to join the guild?	
FormID: 0002D062	MG00Join	jointheMagesGuild	0	Looks to me like you're in trouble with the law. Clear that matter up, and then perhaps we'll discuss the guild.

FormID: 0002D27E	MG00Join	jointheMagesGuild	0	Oh, no. You can't join the guild with that bounty on your head. Get that taken care of, and then come see me again.	
FormID: 0002D27F	MG00Join	jointheMagesGuild	0	The guild is accepting new members, but it may require some hard work on your part. Are you sure you wish to join?	
FormID: 0002D280	MG00Join	jointheMagesGuild	0	You're a wanted criminal, hardly the sort of person that has a place in the guild. Clean up that record of yours, and maybe you'll be considered.

FormID: 0002D282	MG00Join	MG00JoinA	0	Very well. You are now an Associate of the Mages Guild. The full guild hall is now available for your use.	
FormID: 0002D282	MG00Join	MG00JoinA	1	You'll need a recommendation from each local guild hall in order to advance further. Until then, the Arcane University will be closed to you.	
FormID: 0002D282	MG00Join	MG00JoinA	2	Welcome to the guild, and good luck to you.	
FormID: 0002D283	MG00Join	MG00JoinA	0	All right, then. You're now an Associate of the Mages Guild.	
FormID: 0002D283	MG00Join	MG00JoinA	1	Congratulations!	
FormID: 0002D283	MG00Join	MG00JoinA	2	You'll need to receive a recommendation from each local guild hall in Cyrodiil to advance in the guild, and be given any sort of responsibility.	
FormID: 0002D283	MG00Join	MG00JoinA	3	They can be done in any order, but they all must be sent in to the Council before you can enter the Arcane University.

FormID: 0002D284	MG00Join	MG00JoinA	1	You'll need to acquire recommendations from all the local guild hall leaders to advance further in the guild.	
FormID: 0002D284	MG00Join	MG00JoinA	2	If they're smart, they'll take the opportunity to have you perform a small service for them. One good turn deserves another, after all.	
FormID: 0002D284	MG00Join	MG00JoinA	3	We have a responsibility to look after one another, don't we? I dare say we do, no matter what the costs.

FormID: 0002D286	MG00Join	MG00JoinA	1	Now, please keep in mind that you'll need recommendations from every local guild hall in Cyrodiil before you may enter the Arcane University.	
FormID: 0002D286	MG00Join	MG00JoinA	2	I dare say my opinion might carry more weight than others, if you take my meaning. Still, all are necessary to proceed. Good luck to you!

FormID: 0002D287	MG00Join	MG00JoinA	2	To advance in the guild, you'll need recommendations from each local guild hall in Cyrodiil. A feat which I'm sure will elude you completely.	
FormID: 0002D287	MG00Join	MG00JoinA	3	If you manage to actually receive the recommendations, you'll be eligible for entrance to the Arcane University. I shall be quite surprised, as well.	
FormID: 0002D287	MG00Join	MG00JoinA	4	Now unless you wish to attempt to impress me with your no doubt staggering intellect, I have actual work to attend to.	
FormID: 0002D288	MG00Join	MG00JoinA	0	Welcome, child, to the Guild of Mages. You shall be called Associate by all.	
FormID: 0002D288	MG00Join	MG00JoinA	1	Recommendations you need, from all guild halls in Cyrodiil. None will be easy to acquire. Too many motives, too much noise.	
FormID: 0002D288	MG00Join	MG00JoinA	2	May luck be with you, and may your wisdom guide you well. The Arcane University will need your help someday. I have seen it.	
FormID: 0002D289	MG00Join	MG00JoinA	0	Then you are now an Associate of the Mages Guild.	
FormID: 0002D289	MG00Join	MG00JoinA	1	You must receive a recommendation from every local guild hall in Cyrodiil before you may advance through the ranks of the guild.	
FormID: 0002D289	MG00Join	MG00JoinA	2	In the meantime, as a member of the guild, you now have full access to the guild halls around Cyrodiil. Only the Arcane University is closed to you.	
FormID: 0002D071	MG00Join	MG00JoinB	0	No? Very well. Should you change your mind, you know where to find me.	
FormID: 0002D072	MG00Join	MG00JoinB	0	Hmm. Well, that's your choice.	
FormID: 0002D073	MG00Join	MG00JoinB	0	No? Joining the guild is a good idea for anyone who wishes to become a powerful mage, you know.	
FormID: 0002D074	MG00Join	MG00JoinB	0	I see. Let me know if you change your mind. I'm sure I could be helpful.	
FormID: 0002D075	MG00Join	MG00JoinB	0	Hrmph. Not much of a loss, if you ask me.	
FormID: 0002D076	MG00Join	MG00JoinB	0	As you say. Perhaps fate will return you to us, someday?	
FormID: 0002D077	MG00Join	MG00JoinB	0	Well then. If you re-think your decision, I'll be around.

FormID: 000335A6	MS13	FawilTopic	0	Perhaps this journey with you has tought him a lesson. Only time will tell.	
FormID: 00031844	MS13	FawilTopic	0	Farwil is a Dunmer, and he's wearing steel plate armor. His shield should bear the crest of the Knights. Nothing but the best for the Count's son.	Last line said with disdain
FormID: 00031C82	MS13	FawilTopic	0	About two days ago, Count Indarys's son, Farwil, entered the Oblivion Gate with six other men. We haven't heard from them since then.	
FormID: 00031C82	MS13	FawilTopic	1	The Count fears the worst, and has posted guards here so we can watch and see if anyone comes back out. So far, nothing.	
FormID: 00031C82	MS13	FawilTopic	2	At this point, Count Indarys is offering a reward for the recovery of his son from inside the gate... or confirmed news of his demise.	
FormID: 00031C82	MS13	FawilTopic	3	If you find him or the rest of the Knights of the Thorn, get them out of there. I'm sure that the Count would also be pleased if the gate was closed.

FormID: 00033591	MS13	FawilTopic	0	There isn't much more to say. He'll be missed. We'll have to inform the Count... if we get home.	
FormID: 000329F4	MS13	FawilTopic	0	Don't judge Farwil too harshly. Most of what he says is... fabricated. But he's young, and therefore quite brash and inexperienced.	
FormID: 000329F4	MS13	FawilTopic	1	All he wants to do is please his father. I've known him since he was a lad, and fighting to defend Cheydinhal is in his heart.

FormID: 00031ED4	MSFIN	FawilTopic	0	I'll miss him dearly. Don't feel upset, I know you did the best you could to bring him home.	
FormID: 00059090	MSFIN	FawilTopic	0	Even though he may be a bit misguided, I'm still proud to call him my son.	
FormID: 000329E3	MSFIN	FawilTopic	0	It's ashame Farwil is gone. Although he was boastful and aloof, at least he treated me as an equal. I shall miss him.

FormID: 00027F32	MS05	KudEiTopic	0	Yes, I'm the one looking for my friend. His name is Henantier. If you find him, I'll be glad to offer you a sizeable reward.	
FormID: 00027F35	MS05	KudEiTopic	0	Kud-Ei is a member of Bravil's Mages Guild. She put the word out that a good friend of hers went missing.	
FormID: 00027F35	MS05	KudEiTopic	1	She's offered a reward, but as far as I know, nobody's taken her up on the offer. Not sure who's missing either, she's keeping quiet about it.	
FormID: 00027F35	MS05	KudEiTopic	2	I suppose if you're interested, you could head over there and ask Kud-Ei yourself.	
FormID: 00031C7C	MS13	MS13GateHeardNot	0	Well, not much to say really. These gates to... other places... ummm, well... it's very hard to explain. I'm not sure I even understand it.	
FormID: 00031C7C	MS13	MS13GateHeardNot	1	I hear tell that the daedra make their way through these and invade our lands. It's sort of a door to the world where they live.	
FormID: 00031C7C	MS13	MS13GateHeardNot	2	Haven't seen it myself, and don't intend to. Being this close to one makes me nervous. The good news is nothing's come out since Farwil entered.	
FormID: 00031C81	MS13	MS13GateHeard	0	Well then, you know what they're capable of producing. Although, nothing has come through ever since Farwil entered.	
FormID: 000579E1	MS13	MS13Gate	0	Not long ago, one of those foul gates manifested itself just outside the West Gates of our city. Nothing's come out of it yet, but we fear the worst.	
FormID: 000579E1	MS13	MS13Gate	1	My son, Farwil, has taken some knights and entered the gate bravely in hopes of meeting the enemy head-on.	
FormID: 000579E1	MS13	MS13Gate	2	If you want to help, and we can use all the help we can get, head over to the gate and lend a hand to the guards.	
FormID: 000329E4	MS13	MS13Gate	0	The gate has been closed. Finally, thanks to you, the Knights have a real victory on their hands.	
FormID: 000329E9	MS13	MS13Gate	0	I'm sure you wish to hear the real story rather than Farwil's version.	
FormID: 000329E9	MS13	MS13Gate	1	Not long after the gate opened, Farwil decided an assault was in order. We charged inside, and promptly met resistance.	
FormID: 000329E9	MS13	MS13Gate	2	Three of us were cut down in the first wave. We pressed on, at Farwil's behest. At the base of the citadel, we met a larger second wave of foes.	
FormID: 000329E9	MS13	MS13Gate	3	We lost two more in that skirmish, as well as Farwil and I being wounded badly. It was at this point we considered retreat.	
FormID: 000329E9	MS13	MS13Gate	4	We found the way back blocked by more daedra. So we were stuck here until rescued by you. It's just like Farwil to leap before he looks.	
FormID: 000329E9	MS13	MS13Gate	5	Had we brought a City Watch contingent, we might have taken the sigil stone with minimal losses. Instead, Farwil wanted to prove his point.	
FormID: 000329E9	MS13	MS13Gate	6	The City Watch and the Knights of the Thorn are always at odds. They think we don't have what it takes, and Farwil wanted to show them.	
FormID: 000329E9	MS13	MS13Gate	7	Perhaps we're all to blame. But that's not important right now. We must complete our journey and get that stone. Please help us.	
FormID: 00030578	MS13	MS13Gate	0	No more will the gate threaten the good people of Cheydinhal. The Knights of the Thorn have triumphed once more!	
FormID: 00030644	MS13	MS13Gate	0	The sigil stone for this Oblivion Gate is the key. As soon as we have it, we shall rid Cheydinhal of its existence.	
FormID: 0003066E	MS13	MS13Gate	0	I set out with the rest of the Knights to dispatch this blemish on the face of our fine world. When we arrived, we were overwhelmed.	
FormID: 0003066E	MS13	MS13Gate	1	I myself was able to kill perhaps two score of them, but they just kept coming. Only Bremman and I remain alive.	
FormID: 0003066E	MS13	MS13Gate	2	However, with you here now, we can take the sigil stone from that citadel and complete our quest for the good of all Cheydinhal! Huzzah!	
FormID: 000314E8	MS13	MS13Gate	0	It's a great relief that the gate is gone. Now the people of Cheydinhal can breathe easier.	
FormID: 00031845	MS13	MS13Gate	0	We will remain out here until the gate is either closed, or something emerges from inside. We need to warn Cheydinhal of impending attacks.	
FormID: 00031B76	MS13	MS13Gate	0	There's only one way to remove that gate. Venture inside, find the gate's sigil stone and take it. Once you have it, the gate should be closed.	
FormID: 00031B76	MS13	MS13Gate	1	From what I hear, you'll appear back where you entered, safe and sound.	
FormID: 00031C75	MS13	MS13Gate	0	Haven't you heard about these gates to Oblivion opening up all over Tamriel?	
FormID: 000579E3	MS13	MS13Gate	0	If the guards don't do something about the Oblivion Gate soon, I'm leaving town. It's not safe here!	
FormID: 000A3846	MS13	MS13Gate	0	I don't know where it came from, but a mysterious gate appeared outside the walls of our city. The way the guards are reacting, it must be a threat.	
FormID: 000A3846	MS13	MS13Gate	1	They're massing as if bracing for an attack. The portal is just outside the city walls through the west gates if you want to see for yourself.	
FormID: 000A3846	MS13	MS13Gate	2	Be careful, some say the gate leads to the realm of Oblivion itself!	
FormID: 000C452F	MS13Alt	MS13Gate	0	Strangest thing. One minute we're inside Oblivion, and the next thing I know we're back here and the gate falls apart. How odd.	
FormID: 000C4531	MS13Alt	MS13Gate	0	Yes, the Oblivion Gate. No match for the Knights of the Thorn!	
FormID: 000C4531	MS13Alt	MS13Gate	1	When the foul portal cursed Cheydinhal with its presence, we bravely entered to do battle with the vermin within.	
FormID: 000C4531	MS13Alt	MS13Gate	2	We killed scores... nay, hundreds of evil daedra! The ground ran thick with their dark blood.	
FormID: 000C4531	MS13Alt	MS13Gate	3	Then, with a mighty blow, I struck the very ground itself. My true strike sundered the magic of Oblivion and destroyed the gate.	
FormID: 000C4531	MS13Alt	MS13Gate	4	Cheydinhal is safe once again thanks to the Knights of the Thorn! Huzzah!	
FormID: 000C4532	MS13Alt	MS13Gate	0	I'm just glad we escaped with our lives. Oh, don't tell Farwil I said that...

FormID: 0003395F	MG07Leyawiin	AgataTopic	0	She's been a great help to all of us in the guild. Without her, I think Dagail would be lost at times.	
FormID: 00033791	MG07Leyawiin	AgataTopic	0	She's the one you want to talk to if you actually need something to get done around here. I don't even know why Dagail is still around.

FormID: 0003395B	MG07Leyawiin	DagailTopic	0	A nice lady, but strange. Talks to herself far more often than one should, in my opinion.	
FormID: 0003395B	MG07Leyawiin	DagailTopic	1	Sometimes I wonder why she hasn't just retired, and gone someplace to rest.	
FormID: 0003395C	MG07Leyawiin	DagailTopic	0	I heard she was put in charge of the Leyawiin guild hall as a favor, not because she deserved it. That doesn't seem right, does it?	
FormID: 0003395D	MG07Leyawiin	DagailTopic	0	She was a very powerful mage once, from what I understand. Hard to imagine that, honestly.

FormID: 0002E5AA	MG02Alter	MG02Choice1A	1	There was a particular ring of Burden I was testing some time ago. Another stupid Associate somehow got his hands on it, and managed to misplace it.	
FormID: 0002E5AA	MG02Alter	MG02Choice1A	2	If I didn't know better, I'd say he purposely tossed it down the well behind the guild hall. Why he would do such a thing is beyond me.

FormID: 0002E998	MG02Alter	VidkunTopic	3	Thank you for letting me know. I'm sorry that you had to be a part of all of this.	
FormID: 0002E5E8	MG02Alter	VidkunTopic	0	He was an Associate, just like yourself. Perhaps not the brightest, but very eager. He was given his assignment from Falcar, and disappeared.	
FormID: 0002E5E8	MG02Alter	VidkunTopic	1	It's like he dropped out of existence! No one knows what happened, and Falcar won't say a word about it.	
FormID: 0002E5AE	MG02Alter	VidkunTopic	0	Run into him, have you? As I said, he was incompetent. Couldn't pass a simple lesson.	
FormID: 0002E5B1	MG02Alter	VidkunTopic	0	You needn't concern yourself with him. He was unfit to be a guild member, and it's better that he's no longer part of it.

FormID: 000A6576	MS27	MS27LastAyleidKing	1	He appears to have ruled for centuries past the fall of all the other Ayleid kingdoms, if the ancient chronicles are to be believed.	
FormID: 000A6576	MS27	MS27LastAyleidKing	2	But there never was a single King of the Ayleids. Each city-state had its king, and their power waxed and waned over the years.	
FormID: 000A6576	MS27	MS27LastAyleidKing	3	The king of Nenalata was the [QUOTE]last[QUOTE] simply because all the other kings had been destroyed or driven out of Cyrodiil.	
FormID: 0002E5CE	MS27	MS27QuestStart	0	Her name is Herminia Cinna. She lives here in the Imperial City, in the Elven Gardens district.	
FormID: 0002E5CE	MS27	MS27QuestStart	1	She fancies herself a student of the Ayleids, although she sadly lacks any aesthetic instinct whatsover.	
FormID: 0002E5CE	MS27	MS27QuestStart	2	Be that as it may. She has come into possession of an ancient relic known as the Crown of the Ayleids. Your job is to acquire it for me.	
FormID: 0002E5CE	MS27	MS27QuestStart	3	Here is more than enough gold to buy it at any reasonable price. You may keep whatever you do not use as your fee.

FormID: 000A656C	MS27	MS27AyleidCrown	0	It's gone. I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know anything about that. Suit yourself. I know Umbacano is the one who had it stolen.	
FormID: 000A656C	MS27	MS27AyleidCrown	1	I fear for what Umbacano may unleash using that Crown. He is blind to the true nature of the Ayleids.	
FormID: 000A656C	MS27	MS27AyleidCrown	2	If it isn't already too late, we would all be better off if you found a different Ayleid Crown for him.	
FormID: 0002E5CB	MS27	MS27AyleidCrown	0	You want to buy my Ayleid Crown? It isn't for sale, at any price. I would think Umbacano would know that by now.	
FormID: 000A55FD	MS27	MS27AyleidCrown	0	I hope you'll make the right choice. Umbacano must not have the Crown of Nenalata.	
FormID: 000A55FE	MS27	MS27AyleidCrown	0	Have you brought me the Crown of the Ayleids?	
FormID: 000A6581	MS27	MS27AyleidCrown	0	Reputedly the crown worn by the last king of the Ayleids. It deserves to be part of my collection.	
FormID: 0002EDF7	MG04Restore	MG04Choice1B	0	Disappointing. Well, let me know when you are ready.	
FormID: 0002EE4F	MG04Restore	MG04Choice1A	0	Then allow me to explain the task. The Council of Mages has entrusted me with resolving a situation along the Gold Road.	
FormID: 0002EE4F	MG04Restore	MG04Choice1A	1	Several traveling merchants have been found dead along the Gold Road recently, with even more missing. The Council has asked that I put a stop to it.	
FormID: 0002EE4F	MG04Restore	MG04Choice1A	2	You are going to help me do so.	
FormID: 0002FD6C	MG04Restore	MerchantTopic	0	It's a sad thing, to think that a mage would kill helpless merchants for the wares they carry. 	typo
FormID: 0002EE50	MG04Restore	MerchantTopic	0	All found dead along the same stretch of road. The only trait shared amongst them is that each had previously stayed at the Brina Cross Inn nearby.	
FormID: 0002EE50	MG04Restore	MerchantTopic	1	Normally, this would be a matter for the local law enforcement. Due to certain circumstances, however, the Council has become involved.	
FormID: 0002EE50	MG04Restore	MerchantTopic	2	We believe these deaths to be the actions of a rogue Mage.	
FormID: 0003020C	MG04Restore	RogueMage	0	A she, you say? And she's dead? Well, Arielle and Roliand did what needed to be done. No more innocent deaths. At least, for now.	
FormID: 0003020C	MG04Restore	RogueMage	1	You have done well enough for yourself. I'll pass along my recommendation to Raminus.	
FormID: 0003020C	MG04Restore	RogueMage	2	Though I must say, I doubt it will do you much good in the end. You'd be surprised how easily they forget about the little people.	
FormID: 0002FD69	MG04Restore	RogueMage	0	The scrolls I have given you should protect you from the magic the mage seems to use most frequently, but do not let your guard down.	
FormID: 0002FD69	MG04Restore	RogueMage	1	He may have more tricks up his sleeve.	
FormID: 0002EE53	MG04Restore	RogueMage	0	Some mages do not abide by the principles of the guild, and operate outside its boundaries. Many hold little value for the lives of others.	
FormID: 0002EE53	MG04Restore	RogueMage	1	The frost burns found on the victims in this case indicate a mage was responsible for their deaths. Likely nothing more than simple robbery. 	
FormID: 0002EE53	MG04Restore	RogueMage	2	These scrolls should provide sufficient resistance to frost magic, when and if you do encounter this rogue mage. Use them wisely.	
FormID: 0002EE2C	Dark05Assassinated	Dark05Choice1B	0	Very good. Let us hurry to the Gray Mare!	
FormID: 0002EE2A	Dark05Assassinated	Dark05Choice1A	0	Very well. I will wait here until you return. You... you will return, won't you?

FormID: 0002C58A	FGD05Oreyn	AzaniBlackheartTOPIC	0	It's good we've killed him. I'll need his ring as proof that we did the job.	
FormID: 0002C58B	FGD05Oreyn	AzaniBlackheartTOPIC	0	Dead, finally. Good work. Did you retrieve his ring? I want that as proof that the Blackwood Company didn't defeat him.

FormID: 0002C58F	FGD05Oreyn	AzaniBlackheartTOPIC	0	The bastards! There was no battle. Azani must have made a deal with the Blackwood Company. My guess is that they paid him off. 	
FormID: 0002C58F	FGD05Oreyn	AzaniBlackheartTOPIC	1	They get the weapon for Argoth, collect the payment, and tell Azani where the mage is. Easy for Blackheart to retrieve the weapon and collect on it.	DO NOT REC
FormID: 0002C597	FGD05Oreyn	AzaniBlackheartTOPIC	0	We need to find out what happened with him. It's all suspicious to me.	
FormID: 0002C59E	FGD05Oreyn	AzaniBlackheartTOPIC	0	This is his stronghold. Where the Blackwood Company supposedly defeated him. Something's not right here. Come on.	
FormID: 0002C615	FGD05Oreyn	AzaniBlackheartTOPIC	0	That mission was the start of it. That was when Vitellus was killed. We were contracted by a wizard, Argoth, to recover an artifact from Blackheart. 	
FormID: 0002C615	FGD05Oreyn	AzaniBlackheartTOPIC	1	I went in there with twenty men. I left with five. Vitellus wasn't one of them. He died covering our retreat.	
FormID: 0002EE6E	FGD04Defector	FGD04Choice2	0	Honor, huh? I prefer feeding my family. I figure I owe you one for covering for me, so I'll let you leave. Get moving, before I forget myself.	
FormID: 0002EE6F	FGD04Defector	FGD04Choice2	0	That means a lot, coming from you. You think I didn't hear about you ratting me out to Oreyn? Now get out of here before my friend and I get angry.	
FormID: 0002EE6B	FGD04Defector	FGD04Choice1	0	Oh? I know you're the one who ratted me out to Oreyn about that other contract. Go back to Oreyn. Give him my regards. We're done talking. 	
FormID: 0002EE6C	FGD04Defector	FGD04Choice1	0	Look, I know that you covered for me before, so I'll give you this one. Talk to Aryarie at the Mages Guild for the job. After this, we're done.	
FormID: 0002F17A	MG03Illusion	MG03Choice1B	0	No? Well, then please excuse me.	
FormID: 0002F176	MG03Illusion	MG03Choice1A	0	I'm afraid I haven't had time to prepare anything conventional. I'm very preoccupied with this situation concerning Ardaline.	
FormID: 0002F176	MG03Illusion	MG03Choice1A	1	Perhaps you can help with that, however. I can't directly get involved, for fear of embarrassing the poor girl.	
FormID: 0002F176	MG03Illusion	MG03Choice1A	2	I'll need you to have a little chat with Varon Vamori, and you can learn something about the power of Illusion in the process.	
FormID: 0002C6A9	MG03Illusion	VaronVamoriTopic	0	He sold it, eh? Well, this just keeps getting worse.	
FormID: 0002C6A9	MG03Illusion	VaronVamoriTopic	1	Very well. I presume he gave you some indication of where the staff is now located? Take these, and go resolve the situation.	
FormID: 0002C6A9	MG03Illusion	VaronVamoriTopic	2	And, of course, please keep this just between us.	
FormID: 0004CFAD	MG03Illusion	VaronVamoriTopic	0	You have what you need to help him talk. I admit, it's not standard guild procedure, but I'd do anything for one of my girls.	
FormID: 0002F177	MG03Illusion	VaronVamoriTopic	0	I don't understand it. Some ridiculous male thing, I suppose. He's been bothering Ardaline every day for a while now.	
FormID: 0002F177	MG03Illusion	VaronVamoriTopic	1	He even stole her Mages' Staff!	
FormID: 0002F177	MG03Illusion	VaronVamoriTopic	2	Perhaps he thinks it's amusing; I don't know. But it needs to stop. It's making her miserable.	
FormID: 0002F1F5	MG03Illusion	VaronVamoriTopic	0	What? I... I don't know anything about him. I'm sorry. Excuse me.	
FormID: 0002F1F8	MG03Illusion	SorisArenimTopic	0	He lives in the Talos Plaza district of the Imperial City. He's the one who has Ardaline's staff now.

FormID: 0002C67C	MG03Illusion	MagesStaff	1	You needn't tell me the details of what was involved in getting it; it's perhaps better that I know nothing about it.	
FormID: 0002C67C	MG03Illusion	MagesStaff	2	Your actions for the guild more than merit a recommendation. I shall send it to the University promptly.	
FormID: 0002C67C	MG03Illusion	MagesStaff	3	And, to thank you more personally, I shall teach you this spell. You may find it useful in certain circumstances.	
FormID: 0002C67D	MG03Illusion	MagesStaff	0	No staff yet? Well, keep at it. Those charm scrolls should do most of the work for you, if you put them to good use.	
FormID: 0002C55B	MG03Illusion	MagesStaff	0	That thing? Soris keeps it locked in a chest, down in the basement. I don't see why he's so careful with it.

FormID: 0002C0CD	MG03Illusion	MagesStaff	0	Yes, I have the staff Varon sold me. I'm afraid I'm not willing to part with it. I paid good money for it, after all. You understand, of course.	
FormID: 0002BA61	MG03Illusion	MagesStaff	0	What of it? Varon hasn't sent you, has he? I've told him several times now that I simply can't just give it back to him.

FormID: 0002F814	MS46	MS46GoblinMischief	1	They'd boast about it just as if they won it in a war, and pretty soon the Cracked Wood tribe would launch a war against THEM.	
FormID: 0002F814	MS46	MS46GoblinMischief	2	I'm not sure if the Cropsford settlers would be all too pleased about you stirring up a new goblin war, though.	
FormID: 0002F881	Dark05AssassinatedFIN	Dark05FinChoice1B	0	As you wish. Don't worry, the contract will be available whenever you're ready.	
FormID: 0002F880	Dark05AssassinatedFIN	Dark05FinChoice1A	0	I knew you wouldn't be able to resist. Your target is a High Elf named Faelian. He lives somewhere in the Imperial City, and fancies long walks. 	
FormID: 0002F880	Dark05AssassinatedFIN	Dark05FinChoice1A	1	Unfortunately, that's all we know. We don't know which district he calls home, which establishments he frequents, or anything about his schedule.	
FormID: 0002F880	Dark05AssassinatedFIN	Dark05FinChoice1A	2	This contract will require a bit of detective work. I suggest you speak to your fellow Brothers and Sisters and see if they can offer any advice.	
FormID: 0002F880	Dark05AssassinatedFIN	Dark05FinChoice1A	3	Ah yes, there is one more thing. The Imperial City is also home to an Imperial Legion captain named Adamus Phillida. Do you know who that is?	
FormID: 0002F9E8	FGD06DeadViranus	ForsakenMineTOPIC	0	We'd been contracted to clear the place of trolls. It was a tough job, but I felt the men I sent were up to it. I want to know what happened.	
FormID: 0002FF51	Dark01KnifeFIN	BonusTopic	0	Some contracts are straightforward. Find the target, eliminate them, then return to the Sanctuary. No time limits or complications.             	
FormID: 0002FF51	Dark01KnifeFIN	BonusTopic	1	However, many of our clients request that their contracts be carried out in a specific manner. A certain place, a certain method of elimination. 	
FormID: 0002FF51	Dark01KnifeFIN	BonusTopic	2	We try to honor these requests whenever possible. After all, the Dark Brotherhood's reputation has been built on providing... good service.	
FormID: 0002FF51	Dark01KnifeFIN	BonusTopic	3	Any Brother or Sister who can complete a contract while following a specific request will receive a valuable bonus, oftentimes a powerful magic item.	
FormID: 0002FDB6	Dark10SanctuaryFIN	SilencerTopic	0	The Black Hand is the Dark Brotherhood's ruling council. That hand consists of four Speakers and one Listener. Four fingers and a thumb, as it were.	Lucien Lachance -- sinister
FormID: 0002FDB6	Dark10SanctuaryFIN	SilencerTopic	1	This you already know. What is not commonly known among our family members is that the Black Hand employs a few... additional numbers.	Lucien Lachance -- sinister
FormID: 0002FDB6	Dark10SanctuaryFIN	SilencerTopic	2	As every hand has fingers, does not every finger have a nail? A claw? A talon? Every finger of the hand, every Speaker, has such a nail.  	Lucien Lachance -- sinister
FormID: 0002FDB6	Dark10SanctuaryFIN	SilencerTopic	3	These are the Silencers. Each Speaker employs his or her own private assassin, to extend their reach and strike forth as necessary.	Lucien Lachance -- sinister
FormID: 0002FDB6	Dark10SanctuaryFIN	SilencerTopic	4	My previous Silencer perished while fulfilling a contract. That emptiness has now been filled by you. It is an honor without equal.	Lucien Lachance -- sinister
FormID: 0002FD9C	Dark10Sanctuary	PurificationTopic	0	The Dark Brotherhood is an ancient organization. We have survived for millenia. Sometimes, to ensure that survival, drastic measures are required.	Lucien Lachance -- sinister
FormID: 0002FD9C	Dark10Sanctuary	PurificationTopic	1	The Purification is one of the most extreme measures we are forced to carry out. Indeed, it has only been carried out twice. Before now, that is.	Lucien Lachance -- sinister
FormID: 0002FD9C	Dark10Sanctuary	PurificationTopic	2	The Five Tenets are the laws that guide and protect us. But, sometimes, even they must be broken to protect the sanctity of our beliefs.	Lucien Lachance -- sinister
FormID: 0002FD9C	Dark10Sanctuary	PurificationTopic	3	With a Purification, we cleanse the Dark Brotherhood of mistrust and treachery. Those who are slain are offered to Sithis as a symbol of fealty.	Lucien Lachance -- sinister
FormID: 0002FD9C	Dark10Sanctuary	PurificationTopic	4	And, hopefully, we kill the traitor in the process. Until the Purification is complete, no given Sanctuary will ever be considered secure. 	Lucien Lachance -- sinister

FormID: 0002FD6A	MG04Restore	BrinaCrossInnTopic	0	The Inn lies north of Anvil. Speak with Arielle Jurard when you arrive. She will give you further instructions.	
FormID: 0002FD6A	MG04Restore	BrinaCrossInnTopic	1	Do not let your guard down. We do not know whether the Inn's staff is involved somehow.	
FormID: 0002FD6B	MG04Restore	BrinaCrossInnTopic	0	As you are new to the guild, and to the area, you are less likely to be recognized on your trip from Anvil to Kvatch.	
FormID: 0002FD6B	MG04Restore	BrinaCrossInnTopic	1	You will pose as a traveling merchant, and will spend a night at the Inn, which is north of Anvil. After that, continue east along the road.	
FormID: 0002FD6B	MG04Restore	BrinaCrossInnTopic	2	Speak with Arielle Jurard when you arrive. She will be, let's say, [QUOTE]assisting[QUOTE] you with your task.	
FormID: 0002FD6B	MG04Restore	BrinaCrossInnTopic	3	You will find her company most welcome, I believe.	
FormID: 0002FF0B	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	0	Faelian, you say? Why yes, I know who he is. Rather distasteful fellow, actually. I believe he lives right here, at the Tiber Septim Hotel.	
FormID: 0002FF0B	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	1	Talk to the Publican, Augusta Calidia. I'm sure she can tell you more about him.	
FormID: 0004CF8A	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	0	Faelian, you say? Why yes, I know who he is. Rather distasteful fellow, actually. I believe he lives at the Tiber Septim Hotel.	
FormID: 0004CF8A	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	1	I do believe that establishment is right here in the Talos Plaza District. I'd ask around there, if I were you.	
FormID: 0004CF8B	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	0	Faelian, you say? Why yes, I know who he is. Rather distasteful fellow, actually. I believe he lives at the Tiber Septim Hotel.	
FormID: 0004CF8B	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	1	That's in the Talos Plaza District, here in the Imperial City. I'd ask around there, if I were you.	
FormID: 0002FF0C	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	0	Faelian? Yes, I know who he is. But I'm really not in the habit of discussing such things with strangers...	
FormID: 0002FF0D	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	0	Who? Faelian? I don't see how that's any business of yours at all. Really, the gall of some people!	
FormID: 0002FF0E	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	0	I might know him. I might not. I don't see how it's any of your business.	
FormID: 0002FF0F	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	0	Yes, I know who Faelian is. Know quite a bit about him, actually. But... I probably shouldn't gossip. I mean, we hardly know each other...	
FormID: 0002FF10	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	0	Faelian? Oh, I know him all right! A waste of life, that one. He lives here you know, with his sweetheart, Atraena.	
FormID: 0002FF10	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	1	What that poor girl sees in him I'll never know. Atraena pays for their room, their food, everything. She's quite wealthy, I believe.                	
FormID: 0002FF10	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	2	Faelian used to have money... used to be quite a gentleman, too. But that was before he took a fancy to the... you know. The skooma.	
FormID: 0002FF10	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	3	Now Faelian's hardly ever here. He's off using skooma, or wandering the city looking for some, I imagine.  	
FormID: 0002FF10	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	4	He comes back every night to be with Atraena, but only for a few hours. I swear, that High Elf is going to wind up dead if he keeps living like this.	
FormID: 0002FF11	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	0	Oh, just get away from me! My relationship with Faelian is none of your business!	
FormID: 0002FF12	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	0	Faelian? He... he's my sweet. My true love. But I don't know why I'm telling this to you. I mean, we hardly know each other and all...	
FormID: 0002FF13	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	0	Please, I... I don't mean to get emotional but... I feel I can trust you. I just don't know what to do about Faelian!	
FormID: 0002FF13	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	1	All he thinks about, all he cares about, is skooma! He was a fine young man once. But he's lost everything. His looks, his money... his self-respect.	
FormID: 0002FF13	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	2	I followed him a few times, to see where he goes. He walks around the city looking for skooma, and then goes to Lorkmir's house for several hours.   	
FormID: 0002FF13	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	3	It's in the Elven Gardens District. I think the house is deserted. That's why he goes there. So he can escape from life and do his skooma!         	
FormID: 0002FF13	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	4	Thank you for listening. You're a good friend. I just hope my sweet Faelian can clean himself up, or that awful skooma will be the death of him!	
FormID: 00003887	Dark06Wanderer	FaelianTopic	0	Faelian? Hey, that's my name! Yeah. I'm Faelian.	
FormID: 0003003F	MS47	MS47NeedAntidote	0	Really? I find being invisible quite refreshing.	
FormID: 0003003F	MS47	MS47NeedAntidote	1	But, if it will get everyone to leave me alone, fine. I did work out a counter-spell last week... if I can just put my hand to it... ah!	
FormID: 0003003F	MS47	MS47NeedAntidote	2	[Ancotar hands you a scroll.] Here. Stand in the center of town, to make sure you get everyone. Oh, and make sure... never mind. Should be fine.	
FormID: 0003003E	MS47	MS47Eventually	0	Well... in a year or two. Maybe a bit more. There's no way to be absolutely sure. That's the exciting thing about basic research!	
FormID: 0003003D	MS47	MS47AleswellInvisible	0	Oh... Really? Everyone in town?	guiltily ... he already knew this, but was pretending he didn't.
FormID: 0003003D	MS47	MS47AleswellInvisible	1	That must have been what all the shouting was about a few weeks ago. I'm afraid I was engrossed in an experiment that required my full attention.	in a guilty, dog-ate-my-homework sort of voice
FormID: 0003003D	MS47	MS47AleswellInvisible	2	You see, in order to increase the efficacy of the spell, the radius was likely to approach the... never mind. I don't mean to bore you.	eagerly. he's a true magic geek.
FormID: 0003003C	MS47	MS47Invisible	0	Yes, I have been working on a new invisibility spell. As you can see, it works quite well. Why?	
FormID: 0018541E	MS47	MS47Invisible	0	I take no responsibility for your stupidity.	
FormID: 00030136	MS47	MS47Invisible	0	I am sorry about that. Just use the Reverse Invisibility scroll I gave you.	
FormID: 00030137	MS47FIN	MS47Invisible	0	I'm glad to hear that the villagers aren't invisible anymore. It will make it easier for me to avoid them.	
FormID: 0003003B	MS47	FortCaractacusTopic	0	It's just to the southeast of here. Follow the path down the hill. But watch out for the invisible monsters that infest the ruins!	
FormID: 0003003A	MS47	AncotarTopic	0	We're pretty sure he's still hiding out in Fort Caractacus, although he never answers when we've tried to find him.	
FormID: 000301E5	MS47FIN	AncotarTopic	0	We haven't seen him since that whole invisibility mess. I hope it stays that way!	
FormID: 000301E7	MS47FIN	AncotarTopic	0	Typical Altmer. Thinks the whole world is made for his convenience.	
FormID: 000301E7	MS47FIN	AncotarTopic	1	If I had my way, we'd go down there and burn him out. Let him find some other place for his little [QUOTE]experiments.[QUOTE]	
FormID: 000301E8	MS47FIN	AncotarTopic	0	If he's smart, he'll keep out of my way. High elf and a mage to boot, the worst kind of arrogance.	
FormID: 000301E9	MS47FIN	AncotarTopic	0	I say live and let live. It was an unfortunate accident, and he helped make it right. 	
FormID: 000301E9	MS47FIN	AncotarTopic	1	Others in the village are not so forgiving, though. I don't blame him for keeping to himself.	
FormID: 000301EA	MS47FIN	AncotarTopic	0	Don't get me wrong, some of my best friends are elves. But self-important jerks like Ancotar give them all a bad name.	
FormID: 00030039	MS47	MS47HowToHelp	0	He's a wizard who took up residence in the ruins of Fort Caractacus a couple of years ago.	
FormID: 00030039	MS47	MS47HowToHelp	1	He's caused us no end of trouble with his magical experiments, but nothing as bad as this.	
FormID: 00030039	MS47	MS47HowToHelp	2	We've tried to find him, but had no luck. If he's still living in the fort, he's hiding from us, and no wonder.	
FormID: 00030039	MS47	MS47HowToHelp	3	If you could find him and get him to remove this cursed invisibility, we will all be in your debt.	
FormID: 00030038	MS47	MS47WhatHappened	0	Everyone in Aleswell suddenly became invisible several weeks ago. It was sort of fun at first, but the novelty has definitely worn off now.	
FormID: 00030038	MS47	MS47WhatHappened	1	You can imagine how difficult it is to run an inn while invisible. Once you get a reputation as a haunted inn, you can just forget about it.	
FormID: 00030038	MS47	MS47WhatHappened	2	So we've all been keeping quiet, hoping the spell will wear off. But we're running out of patience.	
FormID: 00030038	MS47	MS47WhatHappened	3	We're sure it was Ancotar's doing, but we can't find him. If you can help us, we will be extremely grateful.

FormID: 00030037	MS47	AleswellTopic	1	We've had travellers through recently that say it's turned into a ghost town. Everyone vanished without a trace. 	
FormID: 0000085D	MS47FIN	AleswellTopic	0	I'm glad you were able to help them. I would have done it myself, but I like being invisible.	
FormID: 0000085D	MS47FIN	AleswellTopic	1	Besides, I don't know if they'd have been happy to see me.	
FormID: 00000887	MS47FIN	AleswellTopic	0	It's your own fault. You had two chances to help them. I'm sure they'll get used to being invisible eventually.	
FormID: 0003005E	Dark06WandererFIN	Dark06FinChoice1B	0	Very well. Return to me when you are ready, and the contract is yours.	
FormID: 0003005D	Dark06WandererFIN	Dark06FinChoice1A	0	Excellent. Now listen closely. Nestled in the mountains to the west lies Fort Sutch. It is the home of the warlord Roderick and his mercenaries.	
FormID: 0003005D	Dark06WandererFIN	Dark06FinChoice1A	1	Roderick has recently taken ill. He now lies in eternal slumber, kept alive only by the daily administration of a powerful medicine.	
FormID: 0003005D	Dark06WandererFIN	Dark06FinChoice1A	2	You must infiltrate Fort Sutch, find Roderick's medicine, and replace it with a poisoned bottle I will provide. But you must remain undetected!	
FormID: 0003005D	Dark06WandererFIN	Dark06FinChoice1A	3	Whomever arranged this contract wants it to look like Roderick died from his illness, so discretion is essential. Attack no one! Be seen by no one!	
FormID: 0003005D	Dark06WandererFIN	Dark06FinChoice1A	4	If you are detected, the poisoning will fail, and Roderick must be killed in some other manner. That will, of course, forfeit your bonus.            	
FormID: 000300A3	MG04Restore	MG04Choice3B	0	Very well. If there's anything else I can do for you, let me know.	
FormID: 000300A4	MG04Restore	MG04Choice3A	0	Right then. The bed is just upstairs, at the back of the inn. Sleep well.	
FormID: 0001C4AC	MG04Restore	MG04Choice3A	0	I'm afraid that I can't rent you the room if you can't afford it. Sorry.	
FormID: 000300A2	MG04Restore	MG04Choice2B	0	Of course. It's none of my business, is it?	
FormID: 000300A2	MG04Restore	MG04Choice2B	1	I merely ask out of concern. If you're a merchant, you should be wary. There have been... problems recently.	
FormID: 000300A1	MG04Restore	MG04Choice2A	0	Ah, yes. Thought so. We get many of them traveling through here. Well, we used to.	
FormID: 000300A1	MG04Restore	MG04Choice2A	1	Haven't seen as many lately, what with the... well, you know. The murders.	
FormID: 000300A1	MG04Restore	MG04Choice2A	2	I don't like to talk about it much, as it's bad for business. At any rate, would you care for a bed for the night?	
FormID: 0004F229	MG04Restore	MG04Choice2A	0	Ah! How brave of you, to walk the roads with all of the recent trouble!	
FormID: 0004F229	MG04Restore	MG04Choice2A	1	I myself have been here for some time, hoping to find out what's going on. No luck yet, though.	
FormID: 0004F229	MG04Restore	MG04Choice2A	2	Well, you watch out for yourself, and be careful!	
FormID: 0001C4AB	MG04Restore	bed	0	I hope it's comfortable enough for you.

FormID: 00033792	MG07Leyawiin	SeersStone	1	But we never said anything about Dagail's father. How would he know anything about that?	
FormID: 00033792	MG07Leyawiin	SeersStone	2	If there's some sort of connection between the seer's stone and Dagail's father, I don't know about it. Maybe if you ask her, it will jog her memory.

FormID: 00033793	MG07Leyawiin	SeersStone	0	I'm surprised she discussed it with you. She wanted to keep it from the others... I should speak to her about that.	
FormID: 00033793	MG07Leyawiin	SeersStone	1	Yes, her seer's stone is missing. It's the one thing that has kept her visions at bay, and without it, they're nearly crippling. She can't function.

FormID: 0001E067	MG07Leyawiin	SeersStone	1	Yeah, I know all about it. I overheard Agata and Dagail talking. And you know what? I'm glad it's gone!	
FormID: 0001E067	MG07Leyawiin	SeersStone	2	Why should we be forced to work under someone who's only kept sane by a magical trinket? Haven't we sacrificed enough already?	
FormID: 0001E067	MG07Leyawiin	SeersStone	3	She shouldn't even be here anymore. Hell, the only reason her father ever fit in anywhere is because he kept a low profile. And look what it got him!	
FormID: 0001E067	MG07Leyawiin	SeersStone	4	Years of service to the Empire, and not even a tombstone over his head! Hrmph. At least he was able to maintain the illusion of sanity.	
FormID: 0001E067	MG07Leyawiin	SeersStone	5	I know, I get way too fired up over this. It just annoys me that she's in charge of the guild, when she's clearly not fit. That's all.	typo

FormID: 000366F0	MG17Ambush	MG17ThalfinWhatNow	2	Traven sent word that he wanted you in charge, so you've got it. You're in command. Tell us where you want us.	
FormID: 000366F0	MG17Ambush	MG17ThalfinWhatNow	3	If I may, I'd suggest that you put us in the best possible positions based on our abilities. But it's up to you.	
FormID: 000366EF	MG17Ambush	MG17ThalfinWhy	0	What other choice did I have? We were too exposed, standing around outside the door. I lost one of my men already, and I wasn't willing to lose more.	
FormID: 000366EF	MG17Ambush	MG17ThalfinWhy	1	Rolis tried to make it through the door - he's the one that realized this wasn't going to work. One of their patrols spotted us, and Rolis went down.	
FormID: 000366EF	MG17Ambush	MG17ThalfinWhy	2	So we're stuck. All we can do is wait for them to come out. Then they can't hide any more than we can, and it evens the odds quite a bit.

FormID: 00038584	MS11	MS11Proof	0	What do you mean you disagree? That's a bold statement. What proof do you have that Gelebourne was not a vampire?	
FormID: 00038585	MS11	MS11Proof	0	What do you mean you disagree? That's a bold statement. What proof do you have that Gelebourne was not a vampire?	
FormID: 0003857D	MS11	Gelebourne	0	Yes, I remember Bradon mentioning that name once. He was part of the brotherhood he had created with Raynil.	
FormID: 00038582	MS11	Gelebourne	0	Raynil will pay for both crimes. Gelebourne was likely another innocent he's slain. I'll make sure Skingrad's city watch hears of this.	
FormID: 0009215C	MS11	Gelebourne	0	What proof of your outlandish accusations have you brought me?	
FormID: 00038583	MS11	Gelebourne	0	What proof of your outlandish accusations have you brought me?	
FormID: 00038439	MS11	Gelebourne	0	How'd you know about that? Agh... too many people don't know how to keep quiet about official matters. Very well.	
FormID: 00038439	MS11	Gelebourne	1	The Skingrad city watch informed us that Gelebourne was killed by Raynil not too long ago. Gelebourne was a vampire as well, obviously.	
FormID: 0003844C	MS11	Gelebourne	0	Gelebourne? That's odd you should mention that name. Raynil told me that he was the last vampire he hunted.	
FormID: 0003844C	MS11	Gelebourne	1	Yes... that's right. Somewhere in Skingrad I believe. He said he tracked Gelebourne down and killed him.	REC - Gelebourne mispronounced [QUOTE]Gehl-eh-born[QUOTE] (hard G, not like J)
FormID: 0003844C	MS11	Gelebourne	2	That's apparently why the guards trust him so readily. They had gotten word from Skingrad's city watch about Raynil and his so-called accomplishment.	
FormID: 00038B04	MSFIN	Gelebourne	0	In your absence, I dispatched a runner to Skingrad to let them know they need to clear Gelebourne's name for the record books.	
FormID: 00038B04	MSFIN	Gelebourne	1	Like Bradon, I think he deserves to have his name clear of wrongdoing.	
FormID: 00038444	MS11	MS11ErlineOpinion	0	Well of course it does! It was obviously planted here. Why would he stash a body in his own house? That's ridiculous!	
FormID: 00038444	MS11	MS11ErlineOpinion	1	And another thing. The guards are making a big deal out of no one seeing Bradon out in the daylight. Well of course that's the case!	
FormID: 00038444	MS11	MS11ErlineOpinion	2	He works at night, and has to sleep during the day. Why does that make him a vampire?	
FormID: 00038444	MS11	MS11ErlineOpinion	3	It's all that Raynil character. I don't trust him. The thing that bothers me the most is that I swear I've seen him before.	
FormID: 00038444	MS11	MS11ErlineOpinion	4	Of course he says he's never been here.	REC - Don't say like reply to a question
FormID: 00038444	MS11	MS11ErlineOpinion	5	Look, there isn't much more to say. Please... help me clear my husband's name.	
FormID: 00038443	MS11	MS11TellMe	0	I came home only just a few hours ago. I found the door open, and my Bradon dead. Standing over him was a Dunmer.	
FormID: 00038443	MS11	MS11TellMe	1	I screamed and ran out into the street. Some city watch were nearby and heard me I suppose, as they arrived quickly.	
FormID: 00038443	MS11	MS11TellMe	2	I heard the Dunmer identify himself as Raynil Dralas. He said he was a vampire hunter and that Bradon was his mark.	
FormID: 00038443	MS11	MS11TellMe	3	The guards seemed to know about Raynil, and after a search of the house, the body of some beggar was found stashed in our basement.	
FormID: 00038443	MS11	MS11TellMe	4	The guards sent for Carius, who is an investigator for crimes here in Bruma. In minutes, Raynil convinced Carius that Bradon was a vampire.	
FormID: 00038442	MS11	MS11CalmDown	0	Forgive me. I loved my husband dearly, and to lose him this way makes no sense. Anything you can do to help would be wonderful.	
FormID: 00038442	MS11	MS11CalmDown	1	This is all happening so fast.	
FormID: 00038F11	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	0	No news yet, eh?	
FormID: 0003842A	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	0	Nothing else I can tell you about him. He comes and goes and doesn't talk to people much.	
FormID: 0003842B	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	0	Raynil is staying in the last room down the hall upstairs. Here's the key.	
FormID: 0003842B	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	1	I always liked Bradon and Erline. They were a nice couple. I hope you get to the bottom of this, cause I don't believe he was a vampire either.	
FormID: 0003842E	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	0	He isn't in right now, so you should be clear to check it out. Just don't tell anyone I gave the key to you.	
FormID: 00038430	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	0	I don't usually give out that kind of information. Especially to people I don't know.	
FormID: 00038F13	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	0	Not sure what happened to him, but I certainly haven't seen him.	
FormID: 00038431	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	0	Ahhh, you mean that vampire hunter. He's staying over at Olav's Tap and Tack. It's near the city gates; you can't miss it.	
FormID: 00038F18	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	0	Please, you must avenge Bradon.	
FormID: 0003857E	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	0	I knew I'd recognized Raynil! I think when I first met Bradon many many years ago, he introduced me to him.	
FormID: 0003857E	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	1	They were part of some sort of brotherhood. They would roam Cyrodiil in search of legendary treasures and the like.	
FormID: 0003857E	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	2	The only reason he stopped doing that is because we got married, and he wanted to settle down. I'm afraid thanks to Raynil, that time is lost.	
FormID: 00038436	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	0	I have no idea where he'd be. Just find him, and make him tell you the truth. I swear, he's a liar!	
FormID: 00032679	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	0	Yes, the vampire hunter. As far as I know, he just showed up recently here in Bruma. Not only that, but he already found a vampire among us.	
FormID: 00032679	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	1	Apparently, Bradon Lirrian was one of those vile creatures, and Raynil slew him. Kind of strange though. I never figured Bradon to be a vampire.	
FormID: 00032679	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	2	He seemed to be such a likeable fellow.	
FormID: 00038AFA	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	0	I've provided Raynil's description to all of the Bruma soldiers and even dispatched his description to guards in other cities.	
FormID: 00038AFA	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	1	However, I'm afraid he's slipped through our fingers. If he's as crafty as he's been up to now, he's probably halfway to Vvardenfell.	
FormID: 00038F3C	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	0	You haven't gone to the cave yet? Well, what are you still doing here?	
FormID: 00038589	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	0	I can't wait to get my hands on Raynil. He'll become very familiar with Bruma's dungeons; or the end of my blade if he doesn't come peacefully.	
FormID: 00038438	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	0	I'll warn you about one thing. I understand you wanting to help Erline by checking up on Raynil.	
FormID: 00038438	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	1	We have it on good authority from officials in a neighboring city that Raynil is what he says he is. So I'm not sure what you're trying to prove.	
FormID: 00038438	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	2	I'm only allowing you to do this investigation, and I use that term very loosely, because Erline is so distraught.	
FormID: 00038441	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	0	I'm impressed. It only took him a day to track the vampire down. I guess that's why he does it for a living.	
FormID: 0003843C	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	0	I suppose there's no harm in telling you what happened. Word is bound to get around Bruma anyway.	
FormID: 0003843C	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	1	Turns out that Bradon Lirrian is a vampire. Or was. If it wasn't for Raynil Dralas, we may never have uncovered the truth. Let me explain.	
FormID: 0003843C	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	2	In the last week or so, we've found two bodies stashed in shallow graves outside the city walls. The bodies had puncture wounds on their necks.	
FormID: 0003843C	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	3	The bodies were those of some beggars who used to wander the streets looking for handouts. Vampire probably thought no one would miss them.	
FormID: 0003843C	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	4	Luckily for us, Raynil arrived in town. He said he was a vampire hunter, so we asked for his help.	
FormID: 0003843C	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	5	He tracked the vampire to this house. When he entered the place around noon, Bradon was sleeping. He was able to slay him at that point.	REC end cut off early
FormID: 0003843C	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	6	Luckily, Bradon's wife wasn't home. Poor thing, she didn't even know her husband was infected.	
FormID: 0003843C	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	7	We did a follow up investigation, and it's true that no one recollects seeing Bradon out in the daylight. He's only been spotted at night.	
FormID: 0003843C	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	8	I'm afraid there's not much more to tell you. So, you can see we really don't need any help. But thanks for the offer.	
FormID: 0003843F	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	0	The culprit in this crime has already been dealt with. It's just a matter of wrapping up the details.	
FormID: 0003843F	MS11	RaynilDralasTopic	1	I'd tell you more, but frankly, I don't know who you are, so I'm not sure that I can trust you with that sort of information.	
FormID: 00038AF9	MSFIN	RaynilDralasTopic	0	I'm sorry, there's been no sighting of him yet. Don't know if there ever will be...	
FormID: 00038B00	MSFIN	RaynilDralasTopic	0	You did what had to be done. There should be no regrets or doubts in your mind about it. Raynil was an evil Dunmer, and he deserved that fate.	
FormID: 00038AF4	MSFIN	RaynilDralasTopic	0	Oh... I see.	
FormID: 00038AF4	MSFIN	RaynilDralasTopic	1	I know you meant well... and I suppose there was no need to put your life on the line for a stranger.	
FormID: 00038AF4	MSFIN	RaynilDralasTopic	2	I'm sorry, but I have much to do right now. Please excuse me. Oh, and you should inform Carius of this if you haven't already.	
FormID: 00038AF6	MSFIN	RaynilDralasTopic	0	I'm glad he's dead. I know that's a horrible thing to say, but I think you understand.	
FormID: 00038F0F	MSFIN	RaynilDralasTopic	0	Sad that Raynil slipped away like that.	
FormID: 00038AF1	MSFIN	RaynilDralasTopic	0	I'm glad that scum got what he deserved. Good riddance.	
FormID: 00038F3D	MS11	BradonLirrianTopic	0	You must avenge his unjust death.	
FormID: 00038588	MS11	BradonLirrianTopic	0	If all you say is true, Raynil will answer for Bradon's death.	
FormID: 0003843A	MS11	BradonLirrianTopic	0	I'm sure Erline is very upset. She'll be safe though; Raynil has confirmed with us that she isn't infected.	
FormID: 0003843A	MS11	BradonLirrianTopic	1	Her accusations that Raynil is lying is not surprising. At this point, she's so upset that she'll say anything to deny what really happened.	
FormID: 0003843A	MS11	BradonLirrianTopic	2	I suppose if I found out a loved-one was something as horrid as a vampire, I'd find any excuse not to believe it either.	
FormID: 00038440	MS11	BradonLirrianTopic	0	As far as I know, he was a good man. I never saw this coming. But vampires are masters of deception, so I guess it makes sense.	
FormID: 00038B03	MS11	BradonLirrianTopic	0	Poor fella.	
FormID: 0003844B	MS11	BradonLirrianTopic	0	I know I may be out of line by saying this, but I think the city guards may be wrong. It's hard to imagine Bradon was a vampire.	
FormID: 0003844B	MS11	BradonLirrianTopic	1	I could have sworn I saw him outside in the daylight before. Unless he just got that disease very recently, I'd say they were mistaken.	REC - Misread?
FormID: 0003844B	MS11	BradonLirrianTopic	2	When I heard Raynil killed him, I didn't know what to think. But after your visit here, I'm beginning to wonder.	
FormID: 00038AFB	MSFIN	BradonLirrianTopic	0	It's ashame that there will be no retribution for Bradon and Gelebourne's deaths, but such is the way of things. I know you did your best.	
FormID: 00038AFE	MSFIN	BradonLirrianTopic	0	Although we can't go back and undo what's been done, I feel justice has been served, and Bradon's soul may rest with ease.	
FormID: 0003858C	MS11	MS11LastChance	0	Yes, I suppose it is. Well, then, we've talked enough. Only one of us will walk out of here alive this day. Good luck.	
FormID: 0003858B	MS11	MS11Peaceful	0	Certainly not. I'm surprised Carius didn't send the entire city watch up here. But then I would have seen that coming I suppose.	
FormID: 0003858B	MS11	MS11Peaceful	1	I expected to lay low here for a while and then be on my way. So again, I underestimated you.	
FormID: 0003858B	MS11	MS11Peaceful	2	This leaves me with little choice. Either I fight you now, and have a chance at freedom, or I surrender and rot in a city dungeon.	
FormID: 0003858B	MS11	MS11Peaceful	3	I prefer the chance for freedom.	
FormID: 00038586	MS11	MS11NoneYet	0	Then don't go around, flinging accusation and hearsay. If you dare accuse someone of a crime, you must have the proof to back it up.	
FormID: 00038586	MS11	MS11NoneYet	1	Now, if you believe what you're saying is true, go get me the proof!	
FormID: 00038587	MS11	MS11JournalGive	0	I... I don't know what to say. It all makes perfect sense now. Why else would Raynil have removed this journal from the crime scene in Skingrad?	
FormID: 00038587	MS11	MS11JournalGive	1	I heard no mention of a key either. It must have been removed by Raynil from Bradon's body before we arrived.	
FormID: 00038587	MS11	MS11JournalGive	2	To think that two innocent men were killed, and that I'm responsible for one of their deaths... I... I'm speechless.	
FormID: 00038587	MS11	MS11JournalGive	3	I will rouse the guard, and begin a search for him in the city. Meet me at Olav's Tap and Tack in one hour.

FormID: 00038ABC	NQDSkingrad	Goblinhunting	0	Try the big goblin den called 'Derelict Mine' out east along the Gold Road.	
FormID: 00038ABF	NQDSkingrad	Goblinhunting	0	You heard of 'Goblin Jim's Cave'? It's a big one. It's a long walk due north of Skingrad, in the Imperial Reserve... a long way from civilization.	
FormID: 00038AC2	NQDSkingrad	Goblinhunting	0	My advice is to close quick with the skirmishers... the petty spellcasters... but the shamans are real trouble.	
FormID: 00038AC2	NQDSkingrad	Goblinhunting	1	Shamans have wicked magics... drains, paralyze... bad stuff. Stand off and shoot or spell shamans down if you can.

FormID: 00038A9D	NQDSkingrad	SkingradTopicElse02	0	The gods don't do a damn thing. Do they even exist? How could anyone tell?	
FormID: 00038A9D	NQDSkingrad	SkingradTopicElse02	1	Daedra Lords, sure. They exist. They do things. Bad things, mostly, but things you can see. The gods? They don't do a damn thing.	
FormID: 00038A9D	NQDSkingrad	SkingradTopicElse02	2	So why do we build big chapels and sit around and mumble, and ask them to save us from this and that?	
FormID: 00038A9D	NQDSkingrad	SkingradTopicElse02	3	It's stupid. And chapels and priests and folks groveling on their knees, they're stupid, too.	
FormID: 00038A9C	NQDSkingrad	SkingradTopicElse01	0	Well. Good. I really don't care, either. I just get sick of all the god-talk. Might as well pray to rocks and lamp posts.	
FormID: 00038A8F	NQDSkingrad	SkingradTopicMog02	0	Certainly so. Captain Dione knows her business. And no enemy has ever made it over Skingrad's walls.	
FormID: 00038A8E	NQDSkingrad	SkingradTopicMog01	0	Well. The guards must've been careless. But Captain Dione has the guard on full alert. We'll be safe.	
FormID: 00038A93	NQDSkingrad	UgakgraMogakhTopic	0	My sister, Ugak gra-Mogakh, runs the Grateful Pass Stables. She's the quiet one. I'm the talker.

FormID: 00038B05	MS11	MS11AmuletTalk	0	No. He always feared this day would come. He left me knowledge of that word in the event that he died and I came into possession of the keys.	
FormID: 00038B05	MS11	MS11AmuletTalk	1	If the other members of Bradon's group were still alive, and I on my deathbed, only then would I pass the knowledge onto them.	
FormID: 00038B05	MS11	MS11AmuletTalk	2	If you'd give me that amulet, I would like to show you what you've recovered.	
FormID: 00038B02	MS11	MundaneAmulet	0	Long ago I made a promise to Bradon. I promised to never reveal to anyone what I'm about to reveal to you now.	
FormID: 00038B02	MS11	MundaneAmulet	1	However, because you've avenged his unjust death, I feel that Bradon would understand why I'm breaking that pact.	
FormID: 00038B02	MS11	MundaneAmulet	2	Bradon told me about this amulet when they first brought it home from whatever distant land it came from.	
FormID: 00038B02	MS11	MundaneAmulet	3	He never really trusted anyone else in the group, and before he secured the treasure in that cave, he had a special enchantment placed upon it.	
FormID: 00038B02	MS11	MundaneAmulet	4	The magic masks the true identity of the item. All it takes is a simple command word, and the amulet would be restored to its true state.	
FormID: 00038B0C	MS11	MundaneAmulet	0	Where is the amulet? I would like to see it again before I can tell you of its true nature.	
FormID: 00038B48	ArenaDialogue	ArenaAgronakChoice2	0	I grew up here in the Imperial City, but I was born elsewhere. My mother was a servant in the employ of Lord Lovidicus, and resided at his fortress.	
FormID: 00038B48	ArenaDialogue	ArenaAgronakChoice2	1	Lady Lovidicus was a shrew of a woman. The Lord and my mother grew close, and ultimately fell in love. I was the result of their union.              	
FormID: 00038B48	ArenaDialogue	ArenaAgronakChoice2	2	When the Lady learned of my birth she was furious, and threatened to kill both my mother and me. So we fled, leaving my claim to nobility behind.	
FormID: 00038B47	ArenaDialogue	ArenaAgronakChoice1	0	Oh! Oh, well of course. You have your own concerns, I'm sure, and I should not have imposed. Please excuse my indiscretion.

FormID: 00038ED7	ArenaDialogue	ArenaAgronakChoice4	3	Find this proof and return it to me, and I'll share with you some of my finest combat techniques. Trust me, you can't learn these moves in a book!	
FormID: 00038ED3	ArenaDialogue	ArenaAgronakChoice3	0	Oh! Sorry, I didn't mean to ramble. Go to Crowhaven, to the west. Take this key. It unlocks... something that holds proof of my birth.

FormID: 0003C18A	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	The sisters are hard to tell apart. It's Ugak you'll want to find if you need a mount, though.	
FormID: 0003C18B	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	The Two Sisters is a fine place, and the two sisters themselves are nice people, too.	
FormID: 0003C18C	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I've always liked the place. Mog does a nice job, although I sometimes confuse her with Ugak.	
FormID: 0003C18D	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	Yes, the West Weald is a nice place. Just stay away from Erina when she's in a mood.	
FormID: 0003C18E	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I like the West Weald itself, but I'd rather avoid its proprietor.	
FormID: 0003C18F	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I wouldn't mind making a few bets, but I'm not sure about Graklak. He seems a bit slick to me.	
FormID: 0003C191	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I'll stay away from the topic with her.	
FormID: 0003C192	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	Religion is definitely not a topic to bring up around Else. Swords, on the other hand, she'll talk about.	
FormID: 0003C193	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	Colovian Traders is a good shop. Perhaps I'll visit Gunder soon.	
FormID: 0003C194	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I've bought a number of things from Gunder. I've always been satisfied.	
FormID: 0003C195	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	There's just something wrong with that guy. And he has an odd smell about him.	
FormID: 0003C196	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I'd stay away from him if I were you. There's something very wrong with that man.	
FormID: 0003C197	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	It's a shame such a good smith wastes her life in the bottle.

FormID: 0003C19E	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I think I'd rather take my chances with a disease than have that man try to heal me.	
FormID: 0003C19F	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I've heard rumors about him, but I don't believe they're true.	
FormID: 0003C1A0	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	Maybe there's something strange going on, but Skingrad is a well-run city.	
FormID: 0003C1A3	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	He's a tough one, that's for sure. I wouldn't want to cross him.	
FormID: 0003C1A4	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	He's all business. That's probably good in his line of work, though.	
FormID: 0003C1A5	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	It's a bit strange, but Castle Skingrad is an odd place.	
FormID: 0003C1A6	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I can't imagine it. Still, it's better than not having a butler at all.	
FormID: 0003C1A7	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I don't think he's that impressive. There's no telling him that, though.	
FormID: 0003C1A8	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I can't stand someone who's so full of himself. Someone needs to teach him a lesson.	
FormID: 0003C1A9	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I'm glad he's doing it. Those things are disgusting, a menace to us all.	
FormID: 0003C1AA	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	Goblins are filth. More power to him.	
FormID: 0003C1AB	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	That's good to know. You can never be too careful.	
FormID: 0003C1AC	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I've heard that about Fadus. He's quite impressive.	
FormID: 0003C1AD	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	The more folks hunting goblins, the better. That's what I say.	
FormID: 0003C1B0	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	If Parwen wants to spend all day hunting goblins, I think it's great. Those things are a menace.	
FormID: 0003C1B1	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I've got no interest in talking about some snooty mage.	
FormID: 0003C1B4	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	That's so typical for a mage.	
FormID: 0003C1B5	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	All that conjuring gives me the creeps. There are plenty of scary things in this world without bringing more around.	
FormID: 0003C1B8	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I don't want to learn how to conjure things. I want to learn how to get rid of things.	
FormID: 0003C1BA	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I wouldn't mind learning a bit about Mysticism. Seems like a useful skill.	
FormID: 0003C1BE	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	Mysticism? Seems interesting, but not particularly useful.	
FormID: 0003C1BF	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I'll keep that in mind the next time I need something recharged. Not that it's something that happens every day, of course. 	
FormID: 0003C1C4	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I've never used his services. I mean, how many people have enchanted things just lying around? Outside of the guild, of course.	
FormID: 0003C1C5	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	That's just what this town needs: another reckless mage.	
FormID: 0003C1CB	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	He should be kicked out of town before one of his experiments turns this place into a wasteland.	
FormID: 0003C1D5	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	He's a moron. One of these days, he'll be taught a lesson.	
FormID: 0003C1DB	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	What a fool. I hope he's happy with himself.	
FormID: 0003C1DD	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I can't imagine who'd want to hurt Toutius.	
FormID: 0003C1E3	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I'm sure it's just a rumor. I can't think of a reason why anyone would want to hurt Toutius.	
FormID: 0003C1ED	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	Salmo's baking is fantastic. And her sweetrolls are unbeatable.	
FormID: 0003C1F3	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I could eat nothing but Salmo's baking for the rest of my life. That'd be fine with me.	
FormID: 0003C1F5	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	If I could use a shield as well as Ambrose, I'd charge people for training, too.	
FormID: 0003C1FB	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I've heard he's the best in town with a shield. If you want to learn, go to him.	
FormID: 0003C1FD	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	You can never be too good with a bow. I know I'm not.	
FormID: 0003C203	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I've heard that Reman is good with a bow. Apparently, he's the best in all of Skingrad.	
FormID: 0003C205	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	Can't say I like tomatoes. I'm sure Undena's are good, though.	
FormID: 0003C20B	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	To-MAY-to. To-MAH-to. DAY-dra. DEE-dra. It's all the same to me.	
FormID: 0003C20E	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	No doubt about it, the man loves cheese. And sheep. Just cheese and sheep.	
FormID: 0003C213	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I like cheese. Not more than sheep, though. I'm not sure about Uuras.	
FormID: 0003C216	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	She's a hard worker, and they make some fine wine.	
FormID: 0003C21B	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I've heard she works long hours. It's worth it, though. That's some fine wine.	
FormID: 0003C21E	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	I've heard he's good with his bow, and he'll train you, for a price. I like the wine he makes, too.	
FormID: 0003C223	NQDSkingrad	SkingradNQDResponses	0	With all that time in the vineyard, it's a wonder he has time to practice his marksmanship.

FormID: 0003DFC2	NQDLeyawiin	LeyawiinNQDResponses	0	All day long, stories about severed heads and lopped off limbs. I can do without it.	
FormID: 0003DFC7	NQDLeyawiin	LeyawiinNQDResponses	0	I've heard if you're in the Fighters Guild, you can learn a lot from him.	
FormID: 0003DFCD	NQDLeyawiin	LeyawiinNQDResponses	0	Knowing how to use heavy armor isn't a bad idea. Kind of odd to learn it from a Bosmer, though.	
FormID: 0003DFD2	NQDLeyawiin	LeyawiinNQDResponses	0	She certainly can handle a blade. A bit of a show-off, if you ask me.	
FormID: 0003E218	NQDLeyawiin	LeyawiinNQDResponses	0	She does love to show off her skill. I suppose you can learn a lot from her, though.	
FormID: 0003E255	NQDLeyawiin	LeyawiinNQDResponses	0	I've heard he knows more about Mysticism than almost anyone. Strange about the sheep, though.	
FormID: 0003E2A6	NQDLeyawiin	LeyawiinNQDResponses	0	I don't understand the fascination with sheep. Certainly seems to know everything about Mysticism, though.	
FormID: 0003E2AB	NQDLeyawiin	LeyawiinNQDResponses	0	I've heard he never leaves his laboratory. He's certainly dedicated to his craft.	
FormID: 0003E2AE	NQDLeyawiin	LeyawiinNQDResponses	0	He's a very hard worker. Sometimes I wonder if he ever gets out.	
FormID: 0003E2B2	NQDLeyawiin	LeyawiinNQDResponses	0	Vanashti is a frightening one. I've heard she likes the skooma a bit much.	
FormID: 0003E2B6	NQDLeyawiin	LeyawiinNQDResponses	0	I understand Vashanti has some problems with the skooma. That can't be good for her fighters.	
FormID: 0003C1B9	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	I've eaten many meals there, and I've always been satisfied.	
FormID: 0003C1BC	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	I like the Flowing Bowl. Maenlorn and his brother are excellent hosts.	
FormID: 0003C1C1	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	I enjoy a good bottle of wine, and Wilbur always has a nice selection.	
FormID: 0003C1C2	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	I've had many good meals at the Count's Arms. I've had even more good bottles of wine there.	
FormID: 0003C1C8	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	He's a nice fellow, but he couldn't even get the sign for his store spelled right.	
FormID: 0003C1C9	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	He's not the smartest man, but he's a nice guy. I just hope he can keep his business afloat.	
FormID: 0003C1D0	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	I've never wanted to join up, but I understand Azzan is a good man.	
FormID: 0003C1D1	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	I've heard Azzan is an excellent fighter. I'm not planning on joining up, but if I did, I'd like to work for him.	
FormID: 0003C1D8	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	I understand he's good, but you have to be a member of the Fighters Guild for him to train you.	
FormID: 0003C1D9	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	I don't really have any interest in learning how to use a blunt weapon, but I understand he's very good.	
FormID: 0003C1E0	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	I wouldn't mind learning something, but I don't want to join the Fighters Guild to do it.	
FormID: 0003C1E1	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	You can never know too much about how to handle a sword.	
FormID: 0003C1E8	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	He's quite the pugilist.	
FormID: 0003C1E9	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	I wouldn't want to mix it up with him.	
FormID: 0003C1F0	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	A little skill with a shield can save your life. Of course, she'll only train other Fighters Guild members.	
FormID: 0003C1F1	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	I know that skill with a shield can be invaluable. I don't think I want to join the Fighters Guild to learn, though.	
FormID: 0003C1F8	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	I just don't trust those mages. I especially don't trust ones who can play with your mind like that.	
FormID: 0003C1F9	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	From what I know, Carahil is a powerful mage. I suppose she should be, if she's going to be in the Mages Guild.	
FormID: 0003C200	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	Learning a bit about alchemy would be handy, but you have to be in the Mages Guild for Felen to train you.	
FormID: 0003C201	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	It might be nice to learn how to make better potions.	
FormID: 0003C208	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	Those Destruction spells are dangerous. I hope the Mages Guild keeps a tight lid on that.	
FormID: 0003C209	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	Destruction spells can cause a lot of damage. Knowing enough could make you a dangerous person.	
FormID: 0003C218	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	I've heard that Mirabelle spends a lot of time with the sailors. A lot of personal time with them.	
FormID: 0003C219	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	I've heard a lot of stories about the Fo'c's'le. None of them good.	
FormID: 0003C220	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	He's in great shape, that's for sure. Maybe he could teach me something about his training regimen.	
FormID: 0003C221	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	He's an odd one. Drinks like a fish, but runs like a rabbit.	
FormID: 0003C228	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	You don't see a lot of Human-Bosmer marriages. I don't know if it's even legal in Cyrodiil.	
FormID: 0003C22A	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	I don't know what would possess him to do that. Marrying a Bosmer is just wrong.	
FormID: 0003C23F	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	Pinarus is an impressive tracker. I'd like to see if he can teach me a bit about using a bow.	
FormID: 0003C240	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	You could learn a lot from Pinarus.	
FormID: 0003C255	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	That woman is a bit off-kilter. I don't even want to know what she's got in her basement.	
FormID: 0003C256	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	She's a nut. Whatever's going on in that house, I don't want to know about it.	
FormID: 0003C264	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	She travels a lot to research her books. She's in great shape from all that travel. Maybe she'd teach me a bit about getting into shape.	
FormID: 0003C265	NQDAnvil	AnvilNQDResponses	0	She seems like a good person to talk to. I imagine she could teach me a lot.	
FormID: 0003C29C	MS10	MS10AnyoneWhoCares	0	Well, there's one man who seems to care: Garrus Darelliun, the second in command of the guard. I hear he isn't happy with Ulrich.	
FormID: 0003C29C	MS10	MS10AnyoneWhoCares	1	I don't know what you can do for us in this situation. I mean, Ulrich is the Captain after all. Perhaps you could speak to Garrus.	
FormID: 0003C29C	MS10	MS10AnyoneWhoCares	2	You can find him roaming the County Hall of the castle most of the time.	
FormID: 0003C29B	MS10	MS10Count	0	The Count? He could care less about our plight. As long as the roast suckling pig is delivered to his feast table, he's as happy as can be.	
FormID: 0003C295	MS10	Fines	0	Oh, please. Don't even get me started. That madman won't be satisfied until everyone in town is dead broke... or in jail!	
FormID: 0003C295	MS10	Fines	1	What in Oblivion is Ulrich doing with all that money anyway? I'm sure he's lining his pockets with the gold of the good citizens of Cheydinhal.	
FormID: 0003C295	MS10	Fines	2	Take my good friend Aldos Othran for example. In the last month, he's been fined six times! SIX! All for being drunk and disorderly.	
FormID: 0003C295	MS10	Fines	3	Have you ever gone past a guard barracks? When are they NOT drunk and disorderly? What kind of a stupid fine is that?	
FormID: 0003C295	MS10	Fines	4	Well, Aldos couldn't pay the last two fines, so they seized his home and threw him into the street until he could pay it! Bastards!	
FormID: 0003C29A	MS10	Fines	0	Ever since Ulrich Leland took over the Captain of the Guard post, this city's gone downhill. It's getting almost scary to walk the streets.	
FormID: 0003C29A	MS10	Fines	1	The guards have imposed new, ridiculously heavy fines for every infraction under the sun. They almost seem to make up laws just for charging fines.	
FormID: 0003C29A	MS10	Fines	2	If you can't pay the fine, they can take your property away or toss you in the castle dungeons. Nothing we can do about it really.	
FormID: 0003C29A	MS10	Fines	3	If you're interested, go talk to Llevana Nedaren. She seems the most outspoken against Ulrich and his new fines.	
FormID: 0003C2B7	MS10	MS10AldosTalk	0	I'll go nowhere with you, fetcher! Nowhere!	
FormID: 0003C2B8	MS10	MS10AldosTalk	0	You've been warned. You are now under arrest. Please, come with me.	
FormID: 0003C2B9	MS10	MS10AldosTalk	0	You s'wit! How dare you! Ulrich be damned! He can take his fine and stuff it up his backside!	
FormID: 0003C2BA	MS10	MS10AldosTalk	0	Sir, I must warn you that threatening a city guardsman is an offense punishable by a fine of no less than 50 gold. Pay or be jailed.	
FormID: 0003C2BB	MS10	MS10AldosTalk	0	I said move! Or by my ancestors I'll put you on the ground with a split lip!	
FormID: 0003C2BC	MS10	MS10AldosTalk	0	Sir, this property has been seized by his lordship, the Count of Cheydinhal. Leave immediately.	
FormID: 0003C2CB	MS10	MS10AldosTalk	0	This is my house! Get out of the way... move, I say!	
FormID: 0003C2C4	MS10	MS10WhatAboutLLev	0	Honestly, she's never done anything to be fined or get in trouble... yet. The person I'd love to bring in as a witness is Aldos Othran.	
FormID: 0003C2C4	MS10	MS10WhatAboutLLev	1	That is, if we could sober him up for five minutes.	
FormID: 0003C2C4	MS10	MS10WhatAboutLLev	2	I haven't approached him myself, as Ulrich has eyes everywhere. However, he doesn't know you well enough yet to suspect anything.	REC Ulrich is pronounced [QUOTE]Ull-rick[QUOTE]
FormID: 0003C2C4	MS10	MS10WhatAboutLLev	3	If you want to help, you need to get Aldos to agree to become a witness. Nothing else can be done.	
FormID: 0003C2A6	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	0	Ha! That stupid s'wit! Throw me out of my home, will he? I'll show him a thing or two about messing with an Othran!	
FormID: 0003C2A6	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	1	All I did was fall down, sure. Maybe even vomited on the floor of the tavern. Charge me six times, Ulrich... charge me you fetcher??!	
FormID: 0003C2A6	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	2	Well, I'm not standin' for this any more. You come with me and I'll show you what the Othrans can do when their backs are to the wall.	
FormID: 00090E30	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	0	Although your intentions were good, your actions were despicable. Murder is the lowest form of revenge, and a road I would never dare to tread.	
FormID: 0003ECEF	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	0	Allow me to check with the Count.	
FormID: 0003C33A	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	0	You've done it! This letter will spell his undoing when I present it to Count Indarys. Splendid work, splendid work indeed!	
FormID: 0003C33A	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	1	I must hasten to the Count and deliver this immediately. Please, meet me back at the Cheydinhal Bridge Inn in about two hours.	
FormID: 0003C34C	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	0	I don't see anything here we could use to incriminate Ulrich. You must return with something more tangible. Be careful.	REC Ulrich is pronounced [QUOTE]Ull-rick[QUOTE]
FormID: 0003C350	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	0	I'm very disappointed in you. The proper way to do this would have been my way, but you chose bloodshed. I should have you arrested. 	
FormID: 0003C350	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	1	However, since you aren't fully at fault, I won't report your involvement to the Count. Llevana, on the other hand, will pay for her crime.	
FormID: 0003C350	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	2	I'll ensure that her stay in jail is not long. Obviously, I had no love for Ulrich, so I'll do what I can on her behalf.	REC Ulrich is pronounced [QUOTE]Ull-rick[QUOTE]
FormID: 0003C350	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	3	Now, if you'll excuse me, I must speak to the Count. Please, meet me at the Cheydinhal Bridge Inn in two hours.	REC - Left out [QUOTE]inn[QUOTE]
FormID: 0003C2A7	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	0	Llevana has always been quick tempered. You must reconsider her plan. It can only lead to prison for her... and for you.	
FormID: 0003C2A7	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	1	I swear that Ulrich will pay for this. We must handle this carefully and prove to the Count that he needs to be arrested.	REC Ulrich is pronounced [QUOTE]Ull-rick[QUOTE]
FormID: 0003C2A7	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	2	Ulrich has been watching me, so I haven't been able to enact the plan I devised to bring him down. That ends today now that you're here.	REC Ulrich is pronounced [QUOTE]Ull-rick[QUOTE]
FormID: 0003C2A7	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	3	The evidence we need to incriminate Ulrich must lie within his quarters. You must sneak in there and retrieve it without being seen.

FormID: 0003C2AC	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	0	Beware of Ulrich. I wouldn't confront him at this time, as he'll surely have you thrown in jail.	REC Ulrich is pronounced [QUOTE]Ull-rick[QUOTE]
FormID: 0003C2AC	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	1	If you raise a hand against him and strike him down, you'll be accused of murder. Even if Ulrich doesn't do things by the letter of the law, I do.	REC Ulrich is pronounced [QUOTE]Ull-rick[QUOTE]
FormID: 0003C2AE	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	0	It appears you've spoken to Llevana. I know she sounds a bit like a raving madwoman, but she isn't far from the truth.	
FormID: 0003C2AE	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	1	Ulrich is definitely up to something. Every day, we take in exorbitant fines from the people. Where most of that money goes, I have a good idea.	REC Ulrich is pronounced [QUOTE]Ull-rick[QUOTE]
FormID: 0003C2AE	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	2	Ulrich keeps his quarters locked, but I've glimpsed inside. The things he has in there could never be purchased on a Captain's salary.	REC Ulrich is pronounced [QUOTE]Ull-rick[QUOTE]
FormID: 0003C2AE	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	3	At first I thought maybe he was from wealthy stock, but many of the goods have been delivered recently.

FormID: 0003C2B0	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	0	I can't say I'm prepared to speak to you about that. No telling who will end up finding out.	
FormID: 0003C37D	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	0	Justice has been done. Go tell Garrus what's transpired here. I await my fate.	
FormID: 0003C2B4	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	0	I'll deal with him soon enough.	
FormID: 0003C2C3	MS10	UlrichLelandTopic	0	I don't know where the Count found him, but I sure wish he'd send him back. He's a menace to this town.	
FormID: 0003C337	MSFIN	UlrichLelandTopic	0	Ulrich will be spending years in the city dungeons. This should give him plenty of time to reflect on what he's done.	
FormID: 0003C351	MSFIN	UlrichLelandTopic	0	Don't be upset. I knew what I was doing the moment I asked you to lead Ulrich to me. I was fully aware of the consequences.	
FormID: 0003C351	MSFIN	UlrichLelandTopic	1	Given the opportunity, I think Ulrich would have had me killed. I'm not sorry for what I've done, but I don't wish to be revered as a hero either.	
FormID: 0003C351	MSFIN	UlrichLelandTopic	2	I thank you for your help. I'm sure your conscience weighed heavily upon you as you led Ulrich to his death. You did the right thing.	
FormID: 0003C36D	MSFIN	UlrichLelandTopic	0	Though I'm happy that Ulrich has been removed from his post, I'm still saddened that there'll be no true retribution for Aldos.	
FormID: 0003C36D	MSFIN	UlrichLelandTopic	1	When I was younger, and living in Vvardenfell, my parents instilled in me the code of an-eye-for-an-eye. It's hard not to see that through.	
FormID: 0003C36D	MSFIN	UlrichLelandTopic	2	I'm sorry, I shouldn't berate what you've done for Cheydinhal. Everyone appreciates what you did, as do I.	
FormID: 0003C3B1	MS10	AldosOthranTopic	0	You saw what happened, I had no choice. Aldos attacked first, and I had to defend myself.	
FormID: 0003C3B1	MS10	AldosOthranTopic	1	If you don't like it, take it up with Ulrich.	
FormID: 0003C2A8	MS10	AldosOthranTopic	0	Aldos will be mourned. I won't sit by and watch the innocent being driven to the brink like that. Something must be done, but without bloodshed.	
FormID: 0003C2AA	MS10	AldosOthranTopic	0	Damn. I was afraid this might happen. Poor Dunmer. Please, go tell Llevana the sad news. I must ponder the situation.

FormID: 0003D4A7	MS04	Gang	2	I was sitting in The Flowing Bowl, when the most fetching Nord woman you've ever seen walked in with an equally attractive Imperial woman following.	
FormID: 0003D4A7	MS04	Gang	3	After we exchanged words, I followed them out to a farmhouse. Inside, they asked me to remove my clothes and items.	
FormID: 0003D4A7	MS04	Gang	4	Well... I did... and then suddenly they brandished weapons and robbed me. They sent me away with barely a stitch of clothing! Harlots!

FormID: 0003D4AF	MS04	Gang	0	Gogan and I are really members of the Anvil City Watch. I suppose you could say we work undercover.	
FormID: 0003D4AF	MS04	Gang	1	We've been trying to foil Faustina's gang for months now. Every time we tried to interview a man who was lured there, they refused to talk.	
FormID: 0003D4AF	MS04	Gang	2	The women in the gang picked married men to seduce for just that reason. It was decided the only way to stop this gang was to send in a stranger.	
FormID: 0003D4AF	MS04	Gang	3	You fit the bill perfectly. It's a shame it had to end in so much violence, but someone was bound to get hurt sooner or later.	
FormID: 0003D307	MS04	Gang	0	All I can tell you is that the best place to start is at The Flowing Bowl. It's a tavern located outside the city walls near the waterfront.	
FormID: 0003D307	MS04	Gang	1	Gogan may be able to give you more information beyond that.	
FormID: 0003D30E	MS04	Gang	0	When Gogan was, uh... with the women, they took something quite valuable from him. No... it's not what you're thinking.	
FormID: 0003D30E	MS04	Gang	1	He was carrying a precious family heirloom with him when he was lured out to their lair. It was a small ring given to him on our wedding day.	
FormID: 0003D30E	MS04	Gang	2	The ring belonged to my mother, and has been in the family for generations. I'm willing to give you all the money I have to get it back. 100 gold.	
FormID: 0003D30E	MS04	Gang	3	Can you help us?	
FormID: 0007130C	MS04	Gang	0	Yes, I've noticed some of them in my establishment. They don't break the law while they're here so there's nothing I can do.	
FormID: 0007130C	MS04	Gang	1	If you wait around long enough, I'm sure they'll show up.	
FormID: 0003DC5C	MS04	Gang	0	An all-female gang of thieves has been recently plaguing Anvil with a very unique method of robbing. They pick on only the men.	
FormID: 0003DC5C	MS04	Gang	1	If you want to help us do something about it, go talk to Gogan and Maelona. Let's just say Gogan is intimately involved and leave it at that.	
FormID: 0003D4A1	MSFIN	Gang	0	Everyone's making fun of me because I fell for the siren's charms. Well, now I have the last laugh!	
FormID: 0008676B	MSFIN	Gang	0	I can't believe you just went ahead and killed that gang member. Gogan and I were actually working undercover for the Anvil City Guard.	
FormID: 0008676B	MSFIN	Gang	1	Your actions have set back our investigation, and maybe driven the rest of the gang into hiding. Nice work.	
FormID: 0003D4B4	MSFIN	Gang	0	It appears that you got all of them. We never found evidence of any other members. Nice work!	
FormID: 0003D30D	MS04	MS04HeardNo	0	The women in the gang use their wiles to lure men out to some remote location and rob them blind. It's been going on for some time now.	
FormID: 0003D30D	MS04	MS04HeardNo	1	The city guard hasn't done very much about it, because frankly, the men who are robbed are so embarrassed, they don't want to report it.	
FormID: 0003D30D	MS04	MS04HeardNo	2	Take for example that good-for-nothing husband of mine, Gogan. He cared more about their charms than my own.	
FormID: 0003D30B	MS04	MS04Here2	0	Fine, then best be on your way.	
FormID: 0003D30C	MS04	MS04Here	0	Oh, you heard about that? We were trying to keep it quiet, but people in this city are far too nosy. Very well, since you said you want to help.	
FormID: 0003D30C	MS04	MS04Here	1	I don't suppose you've heard all of the details about the gang of harlots running their little charade here in Anvil have you?	
FormID: 0003D4B1	MS04	MS04SayNo	0	Well, that's never happened before. I suppose we'd have to kill you. I mean, we can't have you going back to Anvil and ruining the whole plan.	
FormID: 0003D4B1	MS04	MS04SayNo	1	But why say no, when it's so much easier, and more lucrative, to say yes? Or are you here for something else?	
FormID: 0003D4A3	MS04	MS04Faustina	0	We'll clean up the mess. Don't concern yourself about it. I'm sure you had no choice.	
FormID: 0003D4A3	MS04	MS04Faustina	1	If you ever find yourself back in Anvil, stop by anytime and say hello. Oh, and please say nothing to anyone about our true identities.	
FormID: 0003D4A3	MS04	MS04Faustina	2	You've done well, and here is the reward that I promised.	
FormID: 0003D4AC	MS04	MS04FinalNo	0	Damn, I knew it! You're working for the city guard aren't you? I didn't think they would be stupid enough to send someone alone, but so be it.	
FormID: 0003D4AC	MS04	MS04FinalNo	1	I should have known after I fenced that stupid ring and discovered it was a fake. Worthless! All part of the guards' plan I suppose.

FormID: 0003F290	MS40	MS40MelisandeRumor	0	My dear, you shouldn't trust rumors. They can get you into horrible trouble.	
FormID: 0003F290	MS40	MS40MelisandeRumor	1	This time, however, you've heard correctly. I might know a thing or two about it.	
FormID: 0003F290	MS40	MS40MelisandeRumor	2	But I'm afraid the information isn't free. You do me a small favor, and then we'll talk about this cure you seek.	
FormID: 0003F291	MS40	MS40MelisandeWitch	0	Oh, my dear! I gave up witchcraft a long, long time ago.	
FormID: 0003F291	MS40	MS40MelisandeWitch	1	But a cure for vampirism... That's something I haven't thought about in quite some time. Very challenging, and potentially dangerous.	
FormID: 0003F291	MS40	MS40MelisandeWitch	2	If you do a little something for me, I'll help you. How does that sound?	
FormID: 0003FBE3	MQ15	MQ15EldamilD3	0	Good. Follow me, and don't worry. You can trust me.	
FormID: 0003FBE4	MQ15	MQ15EldamilD2	0	I understand. Why would you trust me? But you have no choice. I am the only one who can help you escape this place.	
FormID: 0003FBE4	MQ15	MQ15EldamilD2	1	No one wearing the Bands of the Chosen can leave the Grotto. You'll discover that for yourself soon enough.	
FormID: 00047229	MQ15	MQ15EldamilD1	0	No one wearing the Bands of the Chosen can leave this Grotto. The doors will not open, and there is no other way out.	
FormID: 00047229	MQ15	MQ15EldamilD1	1	Here, let me remove them for you ... there. You are no longer a prisoner of the Forbidden Grotto.	
FormID: 00047229	MQ15	MQ15EldamilD1	2	Let me come with you. Let me help you kill Mankar Camoran. I am not without power.	
FormID: 0008B0A9	MQ15	MQ15EldamilD1	0	No one wearing the Bands of the Chosen can leave this Grotto. The doors will not open, and there is no other way out.	
FormID: 0008B0A9	MQ15	MQ15EldamilD1	1	I can remove them, but I will need time. Follow me. There's a spot in the next Grotto where we won't be disturbed.	
FormID: 0003FBE2	MQ15	MQ15EldamilD1	0	No one wearing the Bands of the Chosen can leave this Grotto. The doors will not open, and there is no other way out.	
FormID: 0003FBE2	MQ15	MQ15EldamilD1	1	I can remove them, but I will need time. The Dremora overseer will be here any minute to check up on me. You need to play along until he leaves.	
FormID: 0003FBE2	MQ15	MQ15EldamilD1	2	Just act like a prisoner, and do as I say. Once Orthe leaves, we can find a quiet spot to remove those Bands.	
FormID: 0003FBE0	MQ15	MQ15EldamilC2	0	I was at the sack of Kvatch. They had no chance. We took them by surprise, and we carried the walls in the first assault.	
FormID: 0003FBE0	MQ15	MQ15EldamilC2	1	But they fought on anyway. Desperately. They seemed to think this decadent, mundane world of theirs was worth defending.	
FormID: 0003FBE0	MQ15	MQ15EldamilC2	2	I was slain after the battle was over. Three townsfolk hiding in a cellar attacked me when I entered their house, hunting down survivors.	
FormID: 0003FBE0	MQ15	MQ15EldamilC2	3	They tore me to pieces, although I have no doubt they were immediately killed by my companions.	
FormID: 0003FBE0	MQ15	MQ15EldamilC2	4	I've had plenty of time to ponder my deeds since I came here. Ponder, and regret. An eternity of regret.	
FormID: 0003FBE0	MQ15	MQ15EldamilC2	5	For my weakness, the Master sent me here, to torture my former comrades who showed similar ingratitude for his gift of eternal life.	
FormID: 0003FBDE	MQ15	MQ15EldamilC1	0	I was one of Mankar Camoran's chief lieutenants. I helped plan the Emperor's assassination. I opened the Great Gate at Kvatch.	
FormID: 0003FBDE	MQ15	MQ15EldamilC1	1	We were the Chosen. We saw more clearly than ordinary mortals. We would destroy the world and remake it.	
FormID: 0003FBDE	MQ15	MQ15EldamilC1	2	Mankar Camoran was our leader, our teacher, our Master. He had the secret knowledge. He dealt with Mehrunes Dagon as an equal.	
FormID: 0003FBE1	MQ15	MQ15EldamilB2	0	I bear responsibility for much of the evil that was done in Mankar Camoran's name. I would undo it if I could.	
FormID: 0003FBE1	MQ15	MQ15EldamilB2	1	I never thought I would have a chance to redeem myself, waiting helplessly here in eternity.	
FormID: 0003FBE1	MQ15	MQ15EldamilB2	2	But now you are here. Perhaps you can kill Mankar Camoran. Save Tamriel from Dagon's final victory.	
FormID: 0003FBE1	MQ15	MQ15EldamilB2	3	I can help you. You need my help if you are ever to leave the Forbidden Grotto.	
FormID: 0003FBDF	MQ15	MQ15EldamilB1	0	Perhaps Akatosh heard my prayers. Even here. Even after everything I've done ...	to himself

FormID: 000146FD	TG08Blind	TG08Honor	0	I have need of your special gifts. There is an item, hidden away in a remote monastery. I need you to go get it for me.

FormID: 0006142B	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	I can't believe someone got past him.	
FormID: 0006142C	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	That's incredible. I didn't think it possible.	
FormID: 000614DA	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	Good. It's always the settlements that adventurers get to first.	
FormID: 00061515	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	I'm glad the Resonator is working. Keeps threats contained.	
FormID: 00061518	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	That's good news.	
FormID: 000615E6	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	Good for Thadon. Doesn't help us any.	
FormID: 000615E7	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	I'm sure the Duke is very happy.	
FormID: 000615E9	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	I'm sure Thadon will celebrate appropriately.	
FormID: 0006164F	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	Crucible can be a dangerous place.	
FormID: 00061653	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	There's always intrigue in Crucible.	
FormID: 0006166C	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	Syl tends to jump at shadows.	
FormID: 0006171E	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	The Torch only matters to those in New Sheoth.	
FormID: 0006171F	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	The people of New Sheoth must feel some relief.	
FormID: 00061720	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	That's great for the city, but what about the settlements?	
FormID: 00061758	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	A new ruler in Crucible, and an empty throne in Bliss. Amazing.	
FormID: 00061759	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	Syl's finally dead. I'm not surprised.	
FormID: 00061765	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	It seems there's a lot of turmoil in the Court of Madness.	
FormID: 00061768	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	Seems things are a mess in New Sheoth.	
FormID: 0006176F	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	Thadon and Syl gone. Strange times.	
FormID: 00061786	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	We all knew that's how Thadon would go. But, Syl?	
FormID: 00061793	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	This is terrible. Just terrible.	
FormID: 000617A4	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	If Passwall has fallen, which of us will be next?	
FormID: 000617CC	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	Passwall is only the first, I'm sure. Where are the armies to protect us?	
FormID: 000617CF	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	He may help protect us. We can only hope.	
FormID: 000617D1	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	That should keep Passwall safer. But what about the rest of us?	
FormID: 000617D2	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	Let's hope he's better than the last one.	
FormID: 000617D3	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	I'm sure the armies will protect the city, but what about us?	
FormID: 00061C6A	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	This is good news.	
FormID: 00061C6B	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	Let's hope the Saints and Seducers can protect us.	
FormID: 00061C6C	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	Sheogorath has abandoned the Realm. We're doomed.	
FormID: 00061C6F	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	He can't leave. He still has work to do.	
FormID: 00061C75	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	How can He leave now? That's impossible!	
FormID: 00061C79	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	Amazing. Sheogorath returned just in time.	
FormID: 00061C9B	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	Thank Sheogorath we're safe.	
FormID: 00061CB4	SENQDWilderness	SEWildernessRumorResponses	0	Our Lord has protected us once again.	
FormID: 00042DAE	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	I'm not sure what to make of it.	
FormID: 00042DAF	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	New people in the Isles usually means trouble.	
FormID: 00042DB0	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	I'd steer clear of any newcomers.	
FormID: 00042DB1	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	Adventurers are always causing trouble around here.	
FormID: 00042DB2	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	I don't know why adventurers feel the need to disturb our home.	
FormID: 00060951	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	I'm amazed the Gatekeeper was killed.	
FormID: 000613E3	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	I can't believe the Gatekeeper is dead.	
FormID: 000613E4	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	How did someone manage to kill him?	
FormID: 000613E7	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	Quite a feat to get past the Gatekeeper.	
FormID: 000613E9	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	I'm shocked the Gatekeeper is dead.	
FormID: 000613EB	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	With the Gatekeeper dead, it's good to have the Resonator working again.	
FormID: 000613ED	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	The Isles are safer now.	
FormID: 000613EE	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	That will take care of pesky adventurers.	
FormID: 000613EF	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	I've heard the Resonator is a dangerous thing.	
FormID: 00061408	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	That should deter unwanted guests.	
FormID: 00061425	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	A fool and his Chalice. Wonderful.	
FormID: 00061427	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	Thadon is a drug-addled fool.	
FormID: 0006142E	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	Why would I care if someone is helping Thadon?	
FormID: 00061431	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	We must all be on watch.	
FormID: 00061436	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	Syl has spies everywhere. We are all at risk.	
FormID: 00061465	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	Syl is always threatened.	
FormID: 000614A9	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	The Flame being re-lit is a good sign.	
FormID: 000614AA	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	The Torch once again casts its light on Crucible.	
FormID: 000614AB	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	Perhaps the Torch is a sign of hope.	
FormID: 000614C5	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	Perhaps Syl was right all along.	
FormID: 000614E4	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	I hope the new ruler of Crucible is a good one.	
FormID: 00061721	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	Amazing that someone finally got to Syl.	
FormID: 0006176C	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	Thadon finally did himself in. Good riddance.	
FormID: 0006177E	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	Thadon dead, and Syl gone. This isn't good.	
FormID: 0006177F	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	It's no surprise Thadon killed himself. I'm more shocked about Syl.	
FormID: 00061787	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	If the Fringe has been attacked, Crucible could be next.	
FormID: 00061788	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	Thank Sheogorath it was only a settlement, and not Crucible.	
FormID: 00061789	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	I'm sure Sheogorath's armies can handle it.	
FormID: 00061792	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	Maybe the new Gatekeeper will keep the peace out there.	
FormID: 00061795	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	Perhaps this Gatekeeper will be made of sterner stuff.	
FormID: 000617CD	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	I can't imagine this new Gatekeeper can protect us, either.	
FormID: 00061B75	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	We can all sleep better with the armies at full strength.	
FormID: 00061C67	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	Crucible will be safer with the armies intact.	
FormID: 00061C68	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	Our Lord's armies will destroy these Knights.	
FormID: 00061C6E	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	He'll return. He must return.	
FormID: 00061C71	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	Our Lord cannot be gone.	
FormID: 00061C73	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	Gone? I can't imagine Him leaving us now.	
FormID: 00061C7B	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	I knew Our Lord would protect us.	
FormID: 00061C9F	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	Sheogorath victorious. Madness reigns!	
FormID: 00061CA2	SENQDDementia	SEDementiaRumorResponses	0	We are safe. For now.	
FormID: 000410A3	SENQDMania	SEMiriliUlvenGreetB	0	I have no time for idle chatter with dilettantes. When I'm finished with the Encyclopedia Sheothia, you may study it to your heart's content.	
FormID: 000410A2	SENQDMania	SEMiriliUlvenGreetA	0	I can see that the scope of my research is far beyond the limited understanding of a cretin such as yourself.	
FormID: 000410A2	SENQDMania	SEMiriliUlvenGreetA	1	Let me make it very simple for you. Don't speak to me. Ever.	
FormID: 000410A2	SENQDMania	SEMiriliUlvenGreetA	2	Now, thanks to your rude interruption, I have to start my day's work all over again.	
FormID: 00041212	SEConversations	SEThaedilResponses	0	It was wonderful! Your show was amazing!	
FormID: 00041213	SEConversations	SEThaedilResponses	0	Oh, I loved it! Best I've ever seen. You're one of the Realm's greatest artists, if you ask me.	
FormID: 00041214	SEConversations	SEThaedilResponses	0	Do you call that juggling? You should be ashamed of yourself.	
FormID: 00041215	SEConversations	SEThaedilResponses	0	Shockingly awful, if you really want to know. Worst I've ever seen.	
FormID: 00041211	SENQDMania	SERunsInCirclesYell	0	Ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni!	Very loudly. This is shouted as she sprints at top speed in circles around the town.
FormID: 00041210	SENQDMania	SERunsInCirclesGreetG	0	Hmm... not bad! Better than my old pair. Thanks, friend!	
FormID: 0004120F	SENQDMania	SERunsInCirclesGreetF	0	Sweet and juicy! You're the best!	
FormID: 0004120E	SENQDMania	SERunsInCirclesGreetE	0	Sweet and juicy! I can always count on you, my best pal!	
FormID: 0004120C	SENQDMania	SERunsInCirclesGreetD	0	Nice and crunchy! Thanks!	
FormID: 0004120A	SENQDMania	SERunsInCirclesGreetC	0	Ah! My favorite! You're a good friend, you know that?	
FormID: 00041209	SENQDMania	SERunsInCirclesGreetB	0	Oh no. Oh no no no. No no no no no no no!!	escalating intensity
FormID: 00041208	SENQDMania	SERunsInCirclesGreetA	0	What? What did you say? What did you say?!	escalating intensity
FormID: 00043435	SE38	SE38OddityDonateNo	0	How mercenary of you! You and I both know the Museum is the rightful home for such an Oddity. I hope you change your mind eventually.	miffed
FormID: 00043436	SE38	SE38OddityDonateNo	0	I'm surprised at your attitude. Here I thought you were a patron of my Museum. I only hope you change your mind one day.	miffed
FormID: 00043437	SE38	SE38OddityDonateNo	0	Have it your way. The honor of having one of their items on display in the Museum is enough for most people. But not you, it seems.	miffed
FormID: 00043434	SE38	SE38OddityDonate	0	Oh, how generous of you! This blind Watcher's Eye is sure to draw a crowd.	
FormID: 00043438	SE38	SE38OddityDonate	0	Thank you! It is a truly odd Tentacle. I'm so glad to have one back on display.	
FormID: 00043439	SE38	SE38OddityDonate	0	You really are a dear! A true friend to the Museum. Perhaps Lord Sheogorath himself will come see the exhibit one day.	
FormID: 00079F56	SE38	SE38OddityDonate	0	Fantastic. I can't tell you what it means to me to have this in my collection. You are a good soul.	
FormID: 00081E9E	SE38	SE38OddityDonate	0	Thank you, dearie! My museum just wasn't the same without the ashes on display.	
FormID: 00081E9F	SE38	SE38OddityDonate	0	How sweet! You truly are a patron of the Odd!	
FormID: 00081EA0	SE38	SE38OddityDonate	0	Really? For free? That's so generous of you. I'll put this tomato right back where it belongs in a place of honor!	
FormID: 00081EA1	SE38	SE38OddityDonate	0	Such a benefactor! I'll be sure to mention your generosity to all my other patrons.	
FormID: 00081EA2	SE38	SE38OddityDonate	0	Oh, you are a sweetie. The museum hasn't been the same since this went missing. It's so nice of you to donate it to the cause of Oddity.	
FormID: 00081EA3	SE38	SE38OddityDonate	0	I don't know what to say! You're such a dear! I'm going to put this dagger right back where it belongs.	
FormID: 00081EA4	SE38	SE38OddityDonate	0	Oh, my! I'm so glad to have this back. People have been asking me what happened to my Ring of Disrobing, and I just didn't know what to tell them.	
FormID: 00081EAB	SE38	SE38OddityDonate	0	Wonderful! I'll put you on my list of Special Donors. It's a very exclusive list, you know.	
FormID: 00082423	SE38	SE38OddityDonate	0	Well aren't you a darling? I know just where I'm going to put this.	
FormID: 00082424	SE38	SE38OddityDonate	0	How generous of you! You'd just give it to me? You are a true lover of Oddities, aren't you?	
FormID: 00082425	SE38	SE38OddityDonate	0	That's a lovely gesture! Thank you so much. Everyone will be so glad to have the Ring back where it belongs.	
FormID: 00043428	SE38	SE38Oddity3	0	What a shame. One Sheogorath-shaped amber lump is Odd; two are simply boring. Maybe next time you'll find something really Odd.	
FormID: 00043429	SE38	SE38Oddity3	0	This looks just like the one I have... well, had in the Museum. It seems to have been misplaced. I wish I had the funds to buy it off you...	
FormID: 0004342A	SE38	SE38Oddity3	0	Well, if it doesn't look just like you! So lifelike! My patrons are going to absolutely adore this.	
FormID: 0008F58A	SE38	SE38Oddity3	0	If it isn't the spitting image of Lord Sheogorath himself! So lifelike you can almost see his bad eye twitching! Perfect!	
FormID: 00043414	SE38	SE38OddityNotNow	0	Don't be discouraged! Some people just have better luck than others in finding Oddities.	
FormID: 00081E5D	SE38	SE38OddityNotNow	0	Well, just keep looking and I'm sure something Odd will turn up!	
FormID: 00081E99	SE38	SE38OddityNotNow	0	Oh, don't worry. You'll find something Odd if you keep at it!	encouragingly
FormID: 00043425	SE38	SE38Oddity2	0	Too bad... I already have a deformed Swamp Tentacle. But next time I'm sure you'll find something truly Odd, don't worry.	
FormID: 00043426	SE38	SE38Oddity2	0	Interesting... it looks vaguely familiar, like I once had one of these on display. I only wish I had the funds to buy it off you...	
FormID: 00043427	SE38	SE38Oddity2	0	Wonderful! Looking at the tentacle, I'm not sure whether to be disgusted or terrified. Just the kind of thing I'm looking for!	
FormID: 00043415	SE38	SE38Oddity1	0	Oh... I already have something in the Museum very similar. But don't give up, I'm sure something truly Odd will turn up soon.	
FormID: 00043416	SE38	SE38Oddity1	0	I could swear I once had a Blind Watcher's Eye just like that.... I would like to replace it, but the funds just aren't available.	
FormID: 00043417	SE38	SE38Oddity1	0	Ah! How deliciously odd! I've never seen a Blind Watcher's Eye before. It will have a place of honor in the Museum.	
FormID: 00043412	SE38	SEOddities	0	I'm always looking for new Oddities to add to my collection. Anything unusual, bizarre, strange, or disturbing -- bring it to me!	
FormID: 00043412	SE38	SEOddities	1	I do pay a nominal finder's fee, but of course the real reward is your contribution to posterity.	
FormID: 00043412	SE38	SEOddities	2	Do you have anything that you'd like to contribute to the Museum?	
FormID: 00043413	SE38	SEOddities	0	Have you found a new Oddity that you'd like to contribute to the Museum?	
FormID: 00043F70	SE08	SE08SheldenEnd	0	Right then. You lead the way -- just try not to get us killed. Well, try not to get ME killed.	Selfish, but frightened. Self-entitled.
FormID: 00043F71	SE08	SE08SheldenEnd	0	Fine. Just leave me here to die. Not like anyone will miss me.	Selfish, but frightened. Self-entitled.
FormID: 00043F6D	SE08	SE08SheldenFollow	0	Let's just hurry this up... please?	Worried and frightened. Like he's being chased.
FormID: 00043F6F	SE08	SE08SheldenFollow	0	What do you think I'm doing? I'm not sticking this close to you because I enjoy your pleasing aroma.	Sarcastic.
FormID: 00018703	SE08	SE08SheldenStayHere	0	What do you think I'm standing around here for? It isn't because I like being in this place!	Furious and shouting
FormID: 00043F6E	SE08	SE08SheldenStayHere	0	Stay here? What's wrong with you? I'll be killed! Take me with you! Please?	Starts angry. Tapers off to whining and pleading.
FormID: 00043F6C	SE08	SE08ObeliskTopic	0	The obelisks operate by reflecting and focusing energies in order to create a portal to this Realm.	Matter of fact
FormID: 00043F6C	SE08	SE08ObeliskTopic	1	They can be overloaded and rendered inert by placing the crystalline hearts of the Knights into the obelisk itself. 	Matter of fact
FormID: 00043F6C	SE08	SE08ObeliskTopic	2	Each heart will increase the power of the obelisk until it eventually overloads and shuts down, closing the portal.	Matter of fact
FormID: 00091351	SE08	SE08ObeliskTopic	0	They'll get more and more active as the Greymarch continues. If they've already taken the Fringe, they must have one there already.	
FormID: 00091351	SE08	SE08ObeliskTopic	1	I really hate those things.	
FormID: 0008247F	SE00	SE08ObeliskTopic	0	The obelisks operate by reflecting and focusing energies in order to create a portal to this Realm.	Matter of fact

FormID: 00043F6A	SE08	SE08HaskillKnightsTopic3	0	Lord Sheogorath has never succeeded in doing so. They continue to grow in numbers until Jyggalag himself arrives.	Fearful of the future.
FormID: 00043F6A	SE08	SE08HaskillKnightsTopic3	1	Their advance can be slowed. By destroying the obelisks, the Knights lose their conduits into the Isles.	Matter of fact.
FormID: 00043F69	SE08	SE08HaskillKnightsTopic2	0	Unlike typical invaders, the Knights do not arrive by conventional means. Instead, they enter the Shivering Isles through conduits into this Realm.	Matter of Fact
FormID: 00043F69	SE08	SE08HaskillKnightsTopic2	1	These crystalline obelisks have existed throughout the Realm for all of eternity. You will find they become more active as the Greymarch progresses.	Matter of Fact
FormID: 00043F68	SE08	SE08HaskillKnightsTopic1	0	Although they are not composed of flesh as you know it, like any other enemy, they can be destroyed with sword and spell. 	Matter of fact.
FormID: 00043F68	SE08	SE08HaskillKnightsTopic1	1	Separate the meat from bone, and they will die. When they do so, their crystalline hearts often remain intact. 	Matter of fact.
FormID: 00043F68	SE08	SE08HaskillKnightsTopic1	2	These hearts are a source of power for the agents of Order. You may find them quite useful in certain situations.	Matter of fact.

FormID: 00044F53	SE04Shell	SE04SheoWhatNow	2	I suppose few really do, but that's beside the point. We're going to give you a taste of where you have found yourself. You're going to learn.

FormID: 00045662	SE37	SE37Beast	0	Yes, yes, I know. They're all looking quite tiresome. A Scalon would sure spruce things up a bit, don't you think?	First two sentences are bored and annoyed. Last sentence is hopeful

FormID: 000465AD	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDQuestionResponses	0	It's awful. I feel terrible for her husband. He must be so ashamed.	
FormID: 000465BB	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDQuestionResponses	0	I don't know how he does it. It's no wonder he spends so much time at the Tap and Tack, though.	
FormID: 000465BD	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDQuestionResponses	0	He's a saint. Sure, he spends a bit of time at the Tap and Tack, but you can't blame him.

FormID: 0004660D	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDQuestionResponses	0	Those are dangerous skills for a novice. I hope he trains people well.	
FormID: 0004661B	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDQuestionResponses	0	I've heard many of Alga's stories. She's got a real gift for telling a tale.	
FormID: 0004661D	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDQuestionResponses	0	She's the best bard I've ever met. Of course, being a bard is almost as bad as being a pilgrim. There's no future in it.

FormID: 0004662D	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDQuestionResponses	0	I wouldn't call him a friend. Still, if I wanted to learn more about illusions, he's the one I'd ask.	
FormID: 0004663B	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDQuestionResponses	0	I've heard a number of stories, none of them good. I understand she might have been a hired assassin.

FormID: 0004659E	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDResponses	0	It's a good place to stay. Hafid is quite a good proprietor.

FormID: 000465BC	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDResponses	0	He's sure got his hands full, between smithing and training in light armor. I don't know how he does it.	
FormID: 000465BE	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDResponses	0	He keeps busy. Repairing weapons, training light armor techniques, keeping track of Skjorta....	
FormID: 000465CC	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDResponses	0	He's certainly become more like a Nord over the years. Quite a competent healer, too.	
FormID: 000465CE	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDResponses	0	It's almost as if he grew up in Skyrim. I don't think the church likes it, but his healing skills are invaluable.	
FormID: 000465DC	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDResponses	0	It hardly seems appropriate for a priest of the Nine Divines, but they put up with it.	
FormID: 000465DE	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDResponses	0	Seems odd, given his vocation. Still, I suppose there's no harm.	
FormID: 000465EC	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDResponses	0	He's talented. The Fighters Guild could do a lot worse.	
FormID: 000465EE	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDResponses	0	I can imagine he's a good teacher. The Fighters Guild should be proud of him.	
FormID: 000465FC	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDResponses	0	She's quite a warrior. It's amazing how well she moves in heavy armor.	
FormID: 000465FE	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDResponses	0	It takes a skilled fighter to move well in armor that heavy.

FormID: 0004662E	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDResponses	0	I understand he's willing to train others, but it can cost more than a few gold.	
FormID: 0004663C	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDResponses	0	I'm not surprised, with the way she handles a bow.	
FormID: 0004663E	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDResponses	0	I don't know about her past. All I know is that she's really good with a bow. I wouldn't mind learning a bit from her.	
FormID: 0004664F	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDResponses	0	He loves the place. I've also heard he's quite an accomplished alchemist.	
FormID: 00046650	NQDBruma	BrumaNQDResponses	0	It certainly seems to be his passion. I understand he used to be quite an alchemist. I wonder if he'd teach me more about that.

FormID: 000465B8	NQDBravil	BravilNQDQuestionResponses	0	I've heard Tadrose Helas does excellent work. Perhaps that's why she's always so busy.	
FormID: 000465C1	NQDBravil	BravilNQDQuestionResponses	0	Tadrose is a fine smith, but I understand she only offers services to other Fighters Guild members.	
FormID: 000465C8	NQDBravil	BravilNQDQuestionResponses	0	I believe Kud-Ei is in charge of the Mages Guild here in Bravil. She seems very well liked by other members.	
FormID: 000465D1	NQDBravil	BravilNQDQuestionResponses	0	I've heard she's quite a talented mage, with an extensive knowledge of illusory spells.	
FormID: 000465D8	NQDBravil	BravilNQDQuestionResponses	0	Ardaline makes excellent potions. I imagine she would, since she teaches Alchemy at the Mages Guild.

FormID: 00046592	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	I've heard that he'd rather be a painter. Still, he runs the place well.	
FormID: 00046597	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	She is very well-spoken. I understand she teaches those skills as well.	
FormID: 000465A2	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	She certainly has a talent for speaking. Plus, she's willing to teach others this skill.	
FormID: 000465A7	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	Marz is a gifted healer, and teacher. I know that she longs to return to the swamps, though.	
FormID: 000465B2	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	Were I injured, I'd seek out Marz.	
FormID: 000465B7	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	I've heard he's a talented mage.	
FormID: 000465C2	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	I don't have any interest in learning about Conjuration, but I hear he's very good.	
FormID: 000465C7	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	He's an interesting man, and an amazing fighter.	
FormID: 000465D2	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	I've spoken to him a number of times about inner peace and spiritual harmony. I'm not sure I understood it all.	
FormID: 000465D7	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	She's always busy, that's for sure. I have heard she's a good teacher, though.	
FormID: 000465E2	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	She probably takes on more than she should. Between smithing and training, she's always hard at work.	
FormID: 000465E7	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	I understand that Kud-Ei takes good care of her sisters in the Mages Guild.	
FormID: 000465F2	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	I've heard she'll do anything for other guild members, and that she's an excellent trainer.	
FormID: 000465F7	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	It seems a bit odd. I don't know how Ardaline feels about it.	
FormID: 00046602	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	I've noticed the same thing. I wonder what's going on there.	
FormID: 00046607	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	Surprising, don't you think, since she never seems to leave that guild hall.	
FormID: 00046612	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	There's no doubt that she knows a lot. Years of studying all sorts of things, I'd expect.	
FormID: 00046617	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	I've heard she's quite skilled in Destruction, and is a favorite of Kud-Ei's.	
FormID: 00046622	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	I'm sure Kud-Ei will keep her in check. I know she has Jend teaching other mages now.	
FormID: 00046627	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	He has a way with words, that's for sure. You could learn a lot from him.	
FormID: 00046632	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	I don't know him too well, but I have heard he's a smooth talker.	
FormID: 00046638	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	I've heard that City-Swimmer has learned the value of not being seen. Quite impressive, and she'll teach it to others.	
FormID: 00046642	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	She's a sly one. I understand she's quite sneaky.	
FormID: 00046649	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	Knowing how to use your armor can save your life. Perhaps I should talk to her.	
FormID: 0004664B	NQDBravil	BravilNQDResponses	0	She's a very private person, but I've heard she has a lot of knowledge to share.

FormID: 00046664	ArenaAnnouncer	Announcer	0	The Yellow Team's combatant has slain many opponents with his magical dagger, Shimmerstrike! Let's see if the Blue Team can end his winning streak!

FormID: 00046669	ArenaAnnouncer	Announcer	0	This is an important match, for the winner will advance to the esteemed rank of Gladiator! So without further ado, let the battle begin!	
FormID: 0004666A	ArenaAnnouncer	Announcer	0	It looks like the Yellow Team has pulled a fast one by replacing their combatant with three Argonian prisoners! This should be interesting!     	REC -- line changed to [QUOTE]Argonian prisoners[QUOTE] and not [QUOTE]slaves[QUOTE]
FormID: 0004666B	ArenaAnnouncer	Announcer	0	You almost have to feel bad for the Yellow Team's Khajiit, for the Blue Team's Gladiator is a combatant you know and love! Let's see how they fare!	REC -- rewrite not make non-gender specific
FormID: 0004666C	ArenaAnnouncer	Announcer	0	You've prayed for it, and these combatants have bled for it -- a high stakes advancement match! Let's see who has what it takes to be your new Hero! 	
FormID: 0004666D	ArenaAnnouncer	Announcer	0	Behold as two Heroes meet in the fighting pit for an epic battle worthy of song! Combatants... begin!	
FormID: 0004666E	ArenaAnnouncer	Announcer	0	Put your hands and your voices together for the two brave Heroes who have come to rock the very foundations of this Arena! Lower the gates!	
FormID: 0004666F	ArenaAnnouncer	Announcer	0	I give you... the Blue Team's Hero! Can this brave combatant defeat three opponents and become the next Champion? Let's find out!                 	
FormID: 00046679	ArenaAnnouncer	Announcer	0	[Gasp!] Can this be? The Blue Team combatant is not wearing an Arena Battle Raiment! The Blue Team is hereby disqualified!	
FormID: 0004667A	ArenaAnnouncer	Announcer	0	What a disappointing turn of events this is! Leave the Arena now, combatant from the Blue Team, and hang your head in shame!	
FormID: 0004667B	ArenaAnnouncer	Announcer	0	Good people, we have a winner! All hail the combatant from the Blue Team! Victor from the Blue Team, leave the Arena now and rest! You've earned it!

FormID: 0008FAA9	SE14	SE14DontSendGuards	0	Of course, Lord, though it may be difficult to prevent your Gatekeeper from intervening. I'm sure the residents of Passwall will be most grateful.	
FormID: 00046835	SE14	SE14DontSendGuards	0	As you wish, My Lord. I will tell the residents you will be handling it personally. I'm sure the survivors will be delighted.	
FormID: 0008FAAA	SE14	SE14SendGuards	0	I'm sure that won't be necessary, Lord. Your Gatekeeper can handle it, I'm sure.	
FormID: 00046833	SE14	SE14SendGuards	0	As you wish, My Lord. I'll see that a contingent of Golden Saints is sent to the settlement.

FormID: 0004681C	SE14	SE14Attacks	0	It seems the incident has been taken care of. Your subjects are appreciative, and have sent this as tribute. Well done, My Lord.	
FormID: 0004681D	SE14	SE14Attacks	0	Perhaps you'd forgotten about the attacks on Deepwallow, My Lord? I'm sure the citizens might last a bit longer.	
FormID: 0008FAAD	SE14	SE14Attacks	0	There is the current situation at the Gates of Madness, Lord. Near Passwall? Surely, you hadn't forgotten....	
FormID: 0004681E	SE14	SE14Attacks	0	Fellmoor can still use your assistance, assuming you can find time in your schedule.	
FormID: 0004681F	SE14	SE14Attacks	0	Hale is still under attack. Or had you forgotten? No matter. I'm certain they can hold out a bit longer.	
FormID: 00046820	SE14	SE14Attacks	0	Your attention is still needed at Highcross, though I realize it must be inconvenient for you.	
FormID: 00046821	SE14	SE14Attacks	0	The residents of Split are still in need of your help. At your earliest convenience of course, My Lord.

FormID: 00046823	SE14	SE14Attacks	0	Creatures have been reported in Deepwallow, Lord. Perhaps you should intervene... as it is your job.	
FormID: 0008FAB3	SE14	SE14Attacks	0	There are intruders at the Gates of Madness. Perhaps you'd care to intervene? I'm sure the Gatekeeper can handle it otherwise.	
FormID: 00046824	SE14	SE14Attacks	0	Residents of Fellmoor have complained of creatures encroaching on their lands. Perhaps you might be of some help, time permitting.	
FormID: 00046825	SE14	SE14Attacks	0	Your assistance may be needed in Hale, Lord. If you are otherwise occupied, I'm certain the survivors will understand.	
FormID: 00046826	SE14	SE14Attacks	0	I fear the settlement of Highcross is experiencing some difficulties. Perhaps you should intervene?	
FormID: 00046829	SE14	SE14Attacks	0	I'm afraid the settlement of Split has been the victim of recent attacks. Your aid would be appreciated, I'm sure.

FormID: 00047365	MQ15	MQ15SavageGarden	0	Everyone here died in the Master's service. As the Master promised, we are now immortal, like the daedra.	
FormID: 00047365	MQ15	MQ15SavageGarden	1	But our life here is a nightmare. The creatures of the Garden torment us endlessly. When they kill us, we are soon reborn and the cycle begins again.

FormID: 000473ED	MG00General	ArcaneUniversityTopic	1	Arch-Mage Traven lives there, in the tower. It's a fabulous place - you really should see it some day. I've been there many times myself.	REC[CRLF][QUOTE]TRAY-vin[QUOTE]
FormID: 000473ED	MG00General	ArcaneUniversityTopic	2	The Imperial City just wouldn't be the same without it. Maybe, some day, if you know the right people, you might get a chance to see it.	
FormID: 000473EE	MG00General	ArcaneUniversityTopic	0	Without recommendations from the local guildhalls, you'll never see the inside of it. I dare say that's one of the few things Traven has done right.	
FormID: 000473EE	MG00General	ArcaneUniversityTopic	1	By all means, travel to the Imperial City and get stopped at the gates. You should get used to that sort of rejection.	
FormID: 000473EF	MG00General	ArcaneUniversityTopic	0	It's been the home of the Mages Guild for the longest time. You should see the library they have there!	
FormID: 000473EF	MG00General	ArcaneUniversityTopic	1	It's the only place worth visiting in the Imperial City, if you ask me. I only make the trip if I can't find a specific book here.	
FormID: 000473F0	MG00General	ArcaneUniversityTopic	0	Arch-Mage Traven has closed the doors of the University to all who are not qualified to enter. A wise decision, in my opinion.	
FormID: 000473F0	MG00General	ArcaneUniversityTopic	1	It's in the Imperial City; perhaps some day you may be able to visit him there. He's done wonderful things for this guild.	
FormID: 000473F1	MG00General	ArcaneUniversityTopic	0	Within its walls live those who determine the fate of the guild. It is our stronghold, our sanctuary.	
FormID: 000473F1	MG00General	ArcaneUniversityTopic	1	You will come to know it well, in time. I have seen it.	
FormID: 000473F2	MG00General	ArcaneUniversityTopic	0	The Council of Mages meets there in the Imperial City. That's where the real power of the guild lies.	
FormID: 000473F2	MG00General	ArcaneUniversityTopic	1	If you do what you need to, you'll get there one day. Just don't forget to help those who have aided you on your way.

FormID: 00047462	MG00General	MGSkingradAdrienne	0	That's not surprising. Sometimes I wonder if she forgets to eat, being so focused on that research of hers.

FormID: 000479CB	NQDLeyawiinNPC	JihattTopic	0	Beg pardon. It is a word from the Ta'agra, meaning 'warrior for hire'. 	REC
FormID: 000479CB	NQDLeyawiinNPC	JihattTopic	1	In Ta'agra, the word is vaguely disreputable.  Such a fighter fights for gold rather than for clan or Mane.	REC

FormID: 0004D843	Horses	HorseDecline	0	What a pity. If you change your mind, we have a fine selection of Chestnut horses.	
FormID: 0004F00E	Horses	HorseDecline	0	It's your loss. There is no finer horse in Cyrodiil than the Black horses of Cheydinhal.

FormID: 0004E918	MS39	ElixirofExploration	0	Here it is... my pride and joy. A Grand Elixir of Exploration. Use it in good health, my friend.	
FormID: 0004E918	MS39	ElixirofExploration	1	Of course, if you want more of them, I've whipped up a few. Expensive, but worth every coin.	
FormID: 0004E919	MS39	ElixirofExploration	0	Words fail me at this point. There must be no stone unturned in all Cyrodiil. I don't know what else to say but to thank you.	
FormID: 0004E919	MS39	ElixirofExploration	1	I'm afraid that this version of the Elixir of Exploration will be the last. I've wrung every bit of information from my research that I can.	
FormID: 0004E919	MS39	ElixirofExploration	2	Since you seem so adept at finding the elusive Nirnroot, if you wish to bring me more, I'd be more than happy to compensate you.	
FormID: 0004E919	MS39	ElixirofExploration	3	Again, I thank you for doing my field work. I look forward to getting more Nirnroot from you. And yes, in 24 hours, I'll have the Elixir ready.	
FormID: 0004E91A	MS39	ElixirofExploration	0	We're so close. Just bring 40 Nirnroot samples, and we can make the best version of the Elixir yet!	
FormID: 0004E91B	MS39	ElixirofExploration	0	One Strong Elixir of Exploration for you... and many more for sale if you wish to buy.	
FormID: 0004E91C	MS39	ElixirofExploration	0	You're truly a master explorer. To imagine you've actually acquired 30 more samples. I'm astounded.	
FormID: 0004E91C	MS39	ElixirofExploration	1	As I'm sure you guessed, to make the grand version of the Elixir of Exploration will take still more samples of Nirnroot; 40 to be exact. Good luck!	
FormID: 0004E91C	MS39	ElixirofExploration	2	Oh, and as before, you can pick up your free Elixir in 24 hours.	
FormID: 0004E91D	MS39	ElixirofExploration	0	Without a full 30 samples, I can't extract enough of it to produce the stronger Elixir. Come back when you've found that many.	
FormID: 0004E91F	MS39	ElixirofExploration	0	As promised, I have your Moderate Elixir of Exploration. Use it well! I have more available for a great price if you'd like.	
FormID: 0004E920	MS39	ElixirofExploration	0	Amazing, you've found 20 more samples of Nirnroot! Well done!	
FormID: 0004E920	MS39	ElixirofExploration	1	I think if I'm to create a strong version of the Elixir, I'm going to need an even greater number of Nirnroot samples than before.	
FormID: 0004E920	MS39	ElixirofExploration	2	30 should do it this time. Yes, that would be perfect. Oh, and as usual, I'll have the moderate Elixir ready in 24 hours.	
FormID: 0004E922	MS39	ElixirofExploration	0	I really can't do anything without 20 more samples of Nirnroot. Come back when you have them.	
FormID: 0004E929	MS39	ElixirofExploration	0	Here's a Weak Elixir of Exploration. Not bad, eh? If you want more, you can buy them from me. I've discounted them for you, of course.	
FormID: 0004E92C	MS39	ElixirofExploration	0	Fantastic! You actually found 10 of the Nirnroot. I'll begin making the Elixir of Exploration right away.	
FormID: 0004E92C	MS39	ElixirofExploration	1	According to my research from the tome, I'll need at least 20 more Nirnroot to make the next magnitude of Elixir.	
FormID: 0004E92C	MS39	ElixirofExploration	2	In any case, if you come back in about 24 hours, I should have the weaker Elixir ready for you.	
FormID: 0004E92E	MS39	ElixirofExploration	0	Hmmm... you don't seem to have enough samples on you. Remember, I need at least 10 to get started.	
FormID: 0004E946	MS39	ElixirofExploration	0	The Elixir of Exploration is a multi-purpose potion that was obviously created with the dungeon explorer in mind.	
FormID: 0004E946	MS39	ElixirofExploration	1	The formula describes many magnitudes of the brew. If you're interested, I wrote a short missive about it for the Imperial Alchemy Symposium.	
FormID: 0004E946	MS39	ElixirofExploration	2	You bring me 10 samples of Nirnroot, and I'll make the Elixir available to you at a huge discount as well as give you one for free.	
FormID: 0004E946	MS39	ElixirofExploration	3	The best place for you to start would be Shadeleaf Copse, which is a part of the Great Forest northeast of here.	
FormID: 0004E946	MS39	ElixirofExploration	4	Good luck, and hurry back with more of the Nirnroot!	
FormID: 0004E916	MSFIN	ElixirofExploration	0	Reliable as usual. Here's your gold.	
FormID: 0004E917	MSFIN	ElixirofExploration	0	There's no point in giving you any more money until you've brought me 10 more Nirnroot samples. Come back when you have them.	
FormID: 0004E92D	MS39	Nirnroot	0	If you need to know more about the Nirnroot, read the missive.	
FormID: 0004E977	MS39	Nirnroot	0	A few years ago, an adventurer not unlike yourself sold me a musty old tome containing alchemical formulas. Most of them were worthless.	
FormID: 0004E977	MS39	Nirnroot	1	But one of the moldy pages contained the recipe for a potion known as an Elixir of Exploration, a sort of [QUOTE]ultimate dungeon delver's[QUOTE] brew.	
FormID: 0004E977	MS39	Nirnroot	2	The formula looked sound, except it required an extremely rare ingredient. Yes, you guessed it, the Nirnroot.	
FormID: 0004E977	MS39	Nirnroot	3	I put the book aside, because frankly, I had so many other delicate experiments going on that I just didn't have the time to go plant hunting.	
FormID: 0004E977	MS39	Nirnroot	4	Now that you're here, that changes things.	
FormID: 0004E942	MS39	Nirnroot	0	Yes, this is a genuine Nirnroot sample. Very nice quality in fact.	
FormID: 0004E942	MS39	Nirnroot	1	Hmmm... that gives me an idea. Since you already know what they look like, do you feel up to a bit of a collecting expedition?	
FormID: 0004ED71	MS39	Nirnroot	0	How can I help you examine the Nirnroot if you don't have one? Come back when you intend to show it to me.	
FormID: 0004ED72	MS39	Nirnroot	0	Yes, Nirnroot. Haven't seen any yet? It appears as a slightly glowing shoot that grows right out of the ground.	
FormID: 0004F12A	MS39	Nirnroot	0	Good luck with your field work for Sinderion.	
FormID: 0004E91E	MS39	Nirnroot	0	I dunno. Never seen that sort of root before. Head over to the West Weald Inn and talk to Sinderion. He could identify it for you I'm sure.	
FormID: 0004E921	MS39	Nirnroot	0	Amazing, I've never seen a root quite like that before. If you wish to find out a bit more about it, I know just the person you need to speak to.	
FormID: 0004E921	MS39	Nirnroot	1	Seek out Sinderion, a resident alchemist of Skingrad. Strange plants are his specialty.	
FormID: 0004E931	MS39	Nirnroot	0	Have you taken this to Sinderion in Skingrad yet? As far as alchemists go, you couldn't ask for a more knowledgeable source.	
FormID: 0004E931	MS39	Nirnroot	1	If anyone can help you identify this root, he can.	
FormID: 0004E932	MS39	Nirnroot	0	Yes. I've seen them before. Don't really know anything about them, as I don't specialize in plant samples. However, I know someone who does.	
FormID: 0004E932	MS39	Nirnroot	1	If you make your way to Skingrad, look up Sinderion. He's one of the foremost authorities on the alchemical properties of plants.	
FormID: 0004E933	MS39	Nirnroot	0	What was it called again? Something... root. Agh. Sorry, I can't remember. I'm afraid unusual plants are not my area of expertise.	
FormID: 0004E933	MS39	Nirnroot	1	I think I'll have to refer you to Sinderion. He's a fantastic alchemist in Skingrad who specializes in this sort of thing.	
FormID: 0004E934	MS39	Nirnroot	0	At the last Imperial Alchemy Symposium, I heard Sinderion mention something about a strange glowing root.	
FormID: 0004E934	MS39	Nirnroot	1	I'm afraid I can't remember what he said about them. Perhaps you should make the trip to Skingrad and ask him in person.	
FormID: 0004E935	MS39	Nirnroot	0	Hmph. Ok, I'm stumped. If I had more time, I'd buy that off of you and bring it to Sinderion in Skingrad. He's the expert on strange plants.	
FormID: 0004E935	MS39	Nirnroot	1	Perhaps you should take it to him. If any other alchemist can help you, he certainly can.	
FormID: 0004E93C	MS39	Nirnroot	0	That root seems to have strange properties the likes of which I've yet to see duplicated in other flora of its ilk. Hmmmm...	
FormID: 0004E93C	MS39	Nirnroot	1	I believe that Sinderion in Skingrad could serve your inquiry better, as his area of expertise centers around things of this nature.	
FormID: 0004E93D	MS39	Nirnroot	0	How interesting! I've heard of these glowing roots, but never had the fortune of seeing one. Unfortunately, I know nothing about them.	
FormID: 0004E93D	MS39	Nirnroot	1	You want to speak to Sinderion of Skingrad. He's an alchemist over there who specializes in unusual plants, fungi and roots.	
FormID: 0004E93E	MS39	Nirnroot	0	Hmmm. No. Never seen one of those before. Strikingly beautiful.	
FormID: 0004E93E	MS39	Nirnroot	1	If you find yourself in Skingrad, drop in on the alchemist Sinderion. His specialty is plants, and I bet he could tell you more.	
FormID: 0004E93F	MS39	Nirnroot	0	I can't help you if you don't show me what you're talking about.	
FormID: 0004E943	MS39	MS39No	0	Oh... very well. If you change your mind, I'll be around.

FormID: 0004ED75	MS39	MS39NotSeen	0	Oh. Suit yourself.	
FormID: 0004ED74	MS39	MS39Seen	0	A few years ago, an adventurer not unlike yourself sold me a musty old tome containing alchemical formulas. Most of them were worthless.	
FormID: 0004ED74	MS39	MS39Seen	1	But one of the moldy pages contained the recipe for a potion known as an Elixir of Exploration, a sort of [QUOTE]ultimate dungeon delver's[QUOTE] brew.	
FormID: 0004ED74	MS39	MS39Seen	2	The formula looked sound, except it required an extremely rare ingredient. Yes, you guessed it, the Nirnroot.	
FormID: 0004ED74	MS39	MS39Seen	3	I put the book aside, because frankly, I had so many other delicate experiments going on that I just didn't have the time to go plant hunting.

FormID: 0004F8C0	MS43	MS43Scamps	1	I can't let people know I have scamps in here, or they'll think I've taken to Daedra worship. Try explaining that to the town guard.	
FormID: 00094ECA	MS43	MS43Scamps	0	The Everscamp is unique. Not quite as powerful as a regular scamp, it can barely use magic and is more of an annoyance than a threat.	
FormID: 0004F8BA	MS43	MS43Scamps	0	Oh, yes. Don't bother trying to kill one of them. As soon as you do, another will take its place. It's endless. Quite the curse, eh?

FormID: 0004F8B6	MS43	MS43Staff	0	As promised, here's the ring. I bought it from a shop in the Imperial City many years ago for an ex-lover of mine.	
FormID: 0004F8B6	MS43	MS43Staff	1	He ran off with someone else, so now the ring belongs to you. The owner of the shop called it the Ring of Eidolon's Edge. I think you'll like it.

FormID: 0004F8B9	MS43	MS43Staff	0	Oh please, I beg you! Take this staff to Darkfathom Cave and get rid of it and the scamps forever!	
FormID: 0004F8B9	MS43	MS43Staff	1	I can't fight, and who knows what's guarding the shrine? Plus, do you know how dirty caves are? It'll ruin anything I wear!	
FormID: 0004F8B9	MS43	MS43Staff	2	Do this for me, and I'll reward you with another one of my curios I picked up a few years ago... a valuable ring. Are you ready?	
FormID: 0004F8BD	MS43	MS43Staff	0	Alves should be able to help rid me of this staff. We play cards at the Three Sisters often and are old friends. Seek her advice!	
FormID: 0004F8BF	MS43	MS43Staff	0	A few weeks ago, a spellsword was passing through Leyawiin and heard that I like to buy curiosities. He wanted to sell the staff you see me carrying.	
FormID: 0004F8BF	MS43	MS43Staff	1	I eagerly bought it, knowing the value of Daedric relics. In fact, I was a bit suspicious when he sold it so cheap. His loss, my gain I figured.	
FormID: 0004F8BF	MS43	MS43Staff	2	After examining it for a bit I noticed a small word carved on it in runes. Using a book from my library, I translated it. The word was nonsense.	
FormID: 0004F8BF	MS43	MS43Staff	3	However, when I spoke it and held the staff, four scamps suddenly appeared! I thought I was done for! Strangely, they all just stood there.	
FormID: 0004F8BF	MS43	MS43Staff	4	It didn't take long before I realized they were following me! I couldn't be seen in town with scamps following, so I decided to discard the staff.	
FormID: 0004F8BF	MS43	MS43Staff	5	I can't explain it, but somehow I can't compel myself to actually let it go. This staff is obviously cursed! Now I'm stuck with it!	
FormID: 00094EC8	MS43	MS43Staff	0	Remember, the only way to get rid of the staff is to leave it in that cave.	
FormID: 0004F8BC	MS43	MS43Staff	0	Doing a bit of digging, I'm afraid Rosentia's been stuck with the Staff of the Everscamp. Nasty bit of [QUOTE]fun[QUOTE] by Sheogorath, I'd say.	
FormID: 0004F8BC	MS43	MS43Staff	1	The only way she can be rid of it is if someone willingly accepts it. It can't be discarded in any other manner.	
FormID: 0004F8BC	MS43	MS43Staff	2	No one would buy that thing once it's activated like it's been. The only chance is to return it to its original resting place, Darkfathom Cave.	
FormID: 0004F8BC	MS43	MS43Staff	3	Inside the cave, there's rumored to be a shrine to Sheogorath. That's where the staff can finally be dropped and the scamps should remain behind.	
FormID: 0004F8BC	MS43	MS43Staff	4	I also learned that the staff makes the owner move much slower than normal. I suppose it's another way the creator upped the annoyance factor.	
FormID: 0004F8BC	MS43	MS43Staff	5	Please, bring Rosentia this information at once. And if you can, help her. I think she's about to crack under the pressure, poor thing.	
FormID: 0004F8C4	MS43	MS43Decline	0	I understand. No need to jump headlong into a dangerous situation. But do hurry. I can only keep it a secret for so long.	
FormID: 0004F8C5	MS43	MS43Accept	0	Here's the staff. As soon as you leave, the scamps will thankfully follow. Do be careful, I don't wish your death on my hands as well.	
FormID: 0004F8C2	MS43	MS43StaffTalk	0	I need you to get over to the Mages Guild and talk to a good friend of mine, Alvis Uvenim. She's the only one in town that I trust.	
FormID: 0004F8C2	MS43	MS43StaffTalk	1	I was able to get a message to her earlier, but I've yet to get a reply. If I go, then the scamps will follow and my secret will be revealed to all.

FormID: 00053777	MS09	StolenGold	0	So, he told you another one of his tall tales. I hope you didn't believe him. What's he got in store for me? He send you to kill me? Is that it?	
FormID: 00053777	MS09	StolenGold	1	What if there was another way? What if he thought I was dead, but I wasn't. Then he'd tell you the location of the gold! What did he need as proof?	
FormID: 0005371E	MS09	StolenGold	0	We have to get him to tell us about the gold. Use any trick you can.	
FormID: 00053722	MS09	StolenGold	0	I know what you've heard, all about Jorundr and his run-in with the town guard. Well, let's just say it isn't exactly all true.

FormID: 0005371F	MS09	JorundrTopic	0	Typical. So typical. His stupid paranoia that everyone's a spy and out to get him. I don't know what to suggest.	
FormID: 0005371F	MS09	JorundrTopic	1	Seems the only way he's going to tell us anything is if you end up in jail with him.

FormID: 00053279	MS09	JorundrTopic	1	He was going to skip town on Arnora, but got arrested before making good on his escape. Now she has no money left at all. Poor thing.	
FormID: 00053725	MS09	MS09PleaseGoOn	0	Our last score was a tax shipment being delivered to the Imperial City. We robbed it, and in the midst of the chaos, Jorundr killed a guard.	
FormID: 00053725	MS09	MS09PleaseGoOn	1	I was mortified. We snatched up the gold and holed up in the mountains. He said if I breathed a word of the murder to anyone, he'd kill me.	
FormID: 00053725	MS09	MS09PleaseGoOn	2	I was terrified of him at this point. Two days later, the Bruma City Guard traced us to our makeshift campsite.	
FormID: 00053725	MS09	MS09PleaseGoOn	3	I was off gathering food, but Jorundr was captured. Served him right. When I went back to the site later, the gold was gone! He'd moved it!	
FormID: 00053725	MS09	MS09PleaseGoOn	4	What I need you to do is go to the Bruma Castle Dungeons and speak to him for me. Convince him to tell you where the gold is and then we split it.

FormID: 00053724	MS09	MS09ImIn	0	Smart answer. Here's the deal.	
FormID: 00053724	MS09	MS09ImIn	1	Jorundr and I have had a rocky relationship at best. Against my will, I've been dragged all over Cyrodiil helping him commit petty crimes.	
FormID: 00053724	MS09	MS09ImIn	2	I wouldn't say we're thieves. I mean, we've stolen things... sure. But we've never stolen that much at one time. Just enough to keep us going.	
FormID: 00053724	MS09	MS09ImIn	3	That is, until last year. Jorundr started to take risks and began robbing more dangerous targets. Not just lone merchants, mind you.	
FormID: 00053724	MS09	MS09ImIn	4	I'm talking about the bigger scores. Like estates and tax shipments. I begged him to stop, as I knew that his capers would one day lead to violence.	
FormID: 00053724	MS09	MS09ImIn	5	He just threatened to... hurt me if I got in his way. I think the gold changed him. I really do. He wasn't the man I met seven years ago.

FormID: 000977D9	MS40	VampireAshTopic	2	The vampire you seek is powerful, so powerful that those who sought to destroy him were unsuccessful, no matter what they tried.	
FormID: 000977D9	MS40	VampireAshTopic	3	The best they could do to was to imprison him underground, where he survives to this day.

FormID: 0005373B	MS40	MS40MelisandeIhavethem	0	Ah, wonderful! These will be most useful to me.	
FormID: 0005373B	MS40	MS40MelisandeIhavethem	1	Now, to the matter at hand. You need a cure for vampirism, yes? I believe I can create a potion that will do the trick. But it requires a few things.	
FormID: 0005373B	MS40	MS40MelisandeIhavethem	2	To start, I'll need six cloves of garlic, two shoots of Bloodgrass, and five leaves of Nightshade. Those will be easy enough for you to find.	
FormID: 0005373B	MS40	MS40MelisandeIhavethem	3	But I'll also need the blood of an Argonian, and the ashes of a powerful vampire. Those may be... more difficult for you to acquire.	
FormID: 0005373B	MS40	MS40MelisandeIhavethem	4	Any old Argonian will do, but the vampire must be very powerful indeed. If you succeed, I'll get you what you need. Any questions?	
FormID: 00053739	MS40	ms40melisandenothanks	0	Very well. I imagine if you're so interested in the cure, it's urgent... and perhaps personal? I shall be here if you change your mind.	
FormID: 0005373A	MS40	MS40melisandeWhatdoido	0	I have my own interests, and they occasionally require resources that are difficult for me to acquire. Soul gems, for example.	
FormID: 0005373A	MS40	MS40melisandeWhatdoido	1	If you can bring me five empty Grand Soul Gems, I'm quite sure I can help you with this cure that you seek. I shall await your return.	
FormID: 0005377C	MS09	MS09YourAmulet	0	That fetcher. He knows this is the only heirloom I have left from my family. Only he would stoop so low.	
FormID: 0005377C	MS09	MS09YourAmulet	1	Look, I know you could just kill me where I stand, but what if I gave you the amulet and you bring it to him. Then he'd say where the gold's stashed.	
FormID: 0005377C	MS09	MS09YourAmulet	2	You kill me here and now, and as far as the town guard is concerned, it's a crime. So you make your choice. You want to do it my way, or Jorundr's?	
FormID: 0005377E	MS09	MS09AlternateWay	0	I knew you'd make the smarter decision. Good. Here's the key to the chest by my bed. Inside you'll find the amulet Jorundr wants.	
FormID: 0005377E	MS09	MS09AlternateWay	1	Take my amulet to him. Get the gold and bring half of it back here to me. If you don't come back, I'll let the guards in on our plan.	
FormID: 0005377E	MS09	MS09AlternateWay	2	You'll be hunted all over Cyrodiil. You don't want that do you? I don't think so. Good luck.	
FormID: 0005377D	MS09	MS09JorundrWay	0	Then prepare for the fight of your life! If I fall, you'll just end up rotting in jail with Jorundr. Either way, no gold for you!	
FormID: 0005377A	MS09	MS09MetoDO	0	I'll tell you. I want Arnora dead. That's right, I said dead. She took my life away, now I want hers taken as well.	
FormID: 0005377A	MS09	MS09MetoDO	1	You do this for me, and you get the gold. All of it. All I need as proof is that damn amulet she always wears. Show that to me and the money's yours.	
FormID: 00053778	MS09	MS09SoIHear	0	You want to know what happened? I'll tell you. I was betrayed. Stabbed in the back. I'm in here, and Arnora's out there living in my house.	
FormID: 00053778	MS09	MS09SoIHear	1	We were doing petty crimes all over Cyrodiil. Small scores; 10 gold here, 25 there. Nothing big enough to have them investigate you.	
FormID: 00053778	MS09	MS09SoIHear	2	Then along comes Arnora with a [QUOTE]plan[QUOTE] to waylay a tax shipment headed for the Imperial City. We're talking serious gold, complete with armed escorts.	
FormID: 00053778	MS09	MS09SoIHear	3	I told her she was crazy, but she insisted. Women have a way of getting men to do what they want. So we did it. We ambushed the shipment.	
FormID: 00053778	MS09	MS09SoIHear	4	In the process, Arnora killed a guard. I told her to be careful, and just knock them out but she didn't listen. We then buried the gold in the woods.	
FormID: 00053778	MS09	MS09SoIHear	5	Then she disappears to get [QUOTE]supplies.[QUOTE] Suddenly the campsite gets raided by the Bruma City Guard. There's no way they could have found us.	
FormID: 00053778	MS09	MS09SoIHear	6	There's no doubt she tipped 'em off. But I was one step ahead. I had moved the loot while she was away. Hahaha. My final revenge. Or was it?

FormID: 00054022	MG10Vahtacen	magickasila	1	If we assume it means [QUOTE]Magicka Waxes,[QUOTE] then a spell increasing magicka might be what we need. Something that fortifies it, perhaps.

FormID: 0006A86C	MageConvSystem	MageTalk3	0	Hmph. That just goes to show you how little we really know about the arts magicka. Fireballs and frost bolts are one thing, but this? Incredible...	 
FormID: 0006A861	MageConvSystem	MageTalk2	0	Do you remember that matter you asked me to look into? I have some new information. In short... What you proposed IS possible!	
FormID: 0006A862	MageConvSystem	MageTalk2	0	I've been doing some research in the Mystic Archives. What I discovered... It's more than we could have hoped for!	
FormID: 0006A863	MageConvSystem	MageTalk2	0	I won't take up much of your time. But I felt you should know, I've had a breakthrough!	
FormID: 0006A864	MageConvSystem	MageTalk2	0	Well... You'll recall my hypothesis? The one I mentioned the other day? I'll have you know, I was right! And to think, you actually doubted me!	
FormID: 0006A865	MageConvSystem	MageTalk2	0	I'd been thinking about our conversation yesterday, and decided to consult some of the ancient texts. You were right! About everything!	
FormID: 0006A85C	MageConvSystem	MageTalk1	0	Hmm? Oh, yes, of course. What is it?	
FormID: 0006A85D	MageConvSystem	MageTalk1	0	Well... All right. But please, be brief. I have some... research I need to tend to...	
FormID: 0006A85E	MageConvSystem	MageTalk1	0	I've got a moment, but little more. What do you need?	
FormID: 0006A85F	MageConvSystem	MageTalk1	0	I guess that depends on how much of my precious time you need....

FormID: 00071959	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture5	0	Suppose that the runestones are divine, and that the secrets of their magics are revealed only by divine revelation.	
FormID: 0007195A	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture5	0	Suppose that the runestones existed, for whatever reason, and in whatever form, long before the coming of the Cyrodilic emperors.	
FormID: 0007195B	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture5	0	Suppose, however, that the power of these stones had been hidden, but was revealed to certain holy men or prophets in the First Era.	
FormID: 0007195C	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture5	0	Suppose that, under the guidance of the gods, these runestones were newly consecrated to a great purpose... the founding of the Cyrodilic Empire.	
FormID: 0007195D	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture5	0	Once these ancient monuments might have been powerful bulwarks of the Cyrodilic emperors, battlemages, and priests.	
FormID: 0007195E	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture5	0	But imagine, as the emperors grew weak, and as the power and glory of the Empire waned, and as the people fell away from their service to the gods...	
FormID: 0007195F	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture5	0	Imagine that the power of these runestones might have diminished -- weakened, then extinguished -- by the sins of the Potentates.	
FormID: 00071960	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture5	0	Few records survive from the Dark Ages of the Potentates. Thus might the secrets of the runestones be lost... in wickedness, vainglory, and neglect.	
FormID: 00071951	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture4	0	Ignore the controversy of whether the runestones are enchanted. Let me suggest one possible account for the placements of the runestones.	
FormID: 00071952	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture4	0	Before Tiber Septim, Cyrodiil's roads varied greatly in quality, and were often impassible in bad weather and winter seasons.	
FormID: 00071953	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture4	0	In the late First Era, Empress Hestra improved the roads, and the Reman Emperors continued her policies.	
FormID: 00071954	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture4	0	The last period of First Era road-building was in the reign of the last strong Akaviri Potentate, Sidri-Ashak.	
FormID: 00071955	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture4	0	Note that three classes of runestones are named, respectively, Hestra Stones, Reman Stones, and Sidri-Ashak Stones.	
FormID: 00071956	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture4	0	Could these runestones have served as waypoints and landmarks for military patrols of the nascent Imperial Legion?	
FormID: 00071957	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture4	0	Did battlemages activate runestones on arrival, thus lighting arcane beacons within the next runestone?	
FormID: 00071958	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture4	0	The Mages Guild should fund further study of the early Imperial Legions, their battlemages, and their traditions of patrol and route-finding.	
FormID: 00071949	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture3	0	There are six commonly recognized varieties of runestone.	
FormID: 0007194A	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture3	0	Birthstone Doomstones bear red runes, appear with stone circles, and are associated with the classic birthsigns like the Apprentice and the Atronach.	
FormID: 0007194B	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture3	0	Heavenly Doomstones bear red runes, appear with stone circles, and are associated with cosmic features of the heavens like the moons Jone and Jode.	
FormID: 0007194C	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture3	0	Hestra Runestones are marked with green runes, appear as solitary monuments, and are believed to be named for the late First Era Empress Hestra.	
FormID: 0007194D	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture3	0	Reman Runestones are solitary monuments marked with green runes, almost certainly named for Reman Cyrodiil, the First Era emperor.	
FormID: 0007194E	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture3	0	Sidri-Ashak Runestones are single standing stones marked with green runes, thought to be named for an obscure Akaviri potentate, Sidri-Ashak.	
FormID: 0007194F	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture3	0	Fort Runestones are stones with green runes, found singly or in pairs, in the ruins of some subterranean First Era forts.	
FormID: 00071950	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture3	0	These names offer few hints to the origin or function of the stones, though they assist scholars in identifying each type of stone on maps	
FormID: 00071923	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture2	0	Cyrodiil's runestones are thought to belong to one of three time periods: the Dawn Era, the Merethic Era, or the late First Era.	
FormID: 00071924	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture2	0	Those who believe the runestones to be Dawn Era artifacts, created by the Aedra or Daedra, often describe them as Lorkhan's birthing gift to mortals.	
FormID: 00071925	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture2	0	Others assign the runestones to the Merethic or Early First Era, primarily on the basis of their simple, even crude design and craft.	
FormID: 00071928	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture2	0	The most common practice is to place the raising of the runestones within the High First Era Cyrodiil of Empress Hestra and the Reman Emperors.	
FormID: 00071929	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture2	0	Runestones found in forts like Sancre Tor support a First Era date, though the stones could have been moved to the forts from earlier sites.	
FormID: 0007192C	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture2	0	The greatest objection to First Era dating is that the stones are completely unlike any other examples of First Era architecture.	
FormID: 00071947	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture2	0	I believe the runestones date from the Dawn Era or Merethic Age, but they were moved to new sites by late First Era emperors.	
FormID: 00071948	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture2	0	Since the runestones have lost their enchantments, however, we may never know why they were moved, or what function they served at First Era sites.	
FormID: 00071940	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture1	0	First, all rune-marked ancient stones are called runestones, though there are, in fact, two very different classes of runestones.	
FormID: 00071941	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture1	0	Doomstones have red runes, and are associated with stone circles. Runestones have blue runes, and appear as solitary monuments.	
FormID: 00071942	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture1	0	The runes for which the stones are named glow in the dark; however, there is no evidence that the stones are magical.	
FormID: 00071943	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture1	0	Various naturally occurring minerals and crystals, like glass and ebony, glow in the dark by their own light -- without being magical.	
FormID: 00071944	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture1	0	However, the universal belief that runestones are magical, despite all evidence, is good reason to suspect that the runestones are indeed magical.	
FormID: 00071945	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture1	0	One theory is that the stones were once magical, but they have lost their magic, either through age and disuse, or because of sin or neglect.	
FormID: 00071946	MageConvSystem	ArcaneULecture1	0	It may also be that they are magical, but only for certain individuals or under certain circumstances, or that their magics are secret.

FormID: 000811C7	SE05	SE05PostTortureGreet	0	Your efforts are futile. You'll get nothing from me!	
FormID: 000811CA	SE05	SE05PostTortureGreet	0	You may continue to do your worst, Inquisitor, but unless you have some evidence of this preposterous conspiracy, you'll get nothing from me.	
FormID: 00080D79	SE05	SE05PostTortureGreet	0	Please. I am not involved... I didn't do anything! They wanted me to get them close to Syl, but I wouldn't abide them!	
FormID: 00080D42	SE05	SE05PostTortureGreet	0	All right, all right... please, just stop. I don't know anything specific, but Anya has been looking scared lately.	
FormID: 00080D42	SE05	SE05PostTortureGreet	1	More scared than usual. I think something's going on with her. Now please, leave me alone!	
FormID: 00080D43	SE05	SE05PostTortureGreet	0	I swear, I know nothing about a conspiracy!	
FormID: 0007FF43	SE05	SE05PostTortureGreet	0	Please, no more...	
FormID: 0007FF60	SE06	SEAltarofRaptureTopic	0	The counterpart to the Altar of Despair. Rapture is currently held by the Aureals, in their complacency, but that will soon change.	
FormID: 0007FF61	SE06	SEAltarofRaptureTopic	0	It is just there, at the top of these steps. You would pray for the blinding ecstasy which is the ultimate reward for those in Sheogorath's service?	
FormID: 0007FF62	SE06	SEAltarofRaptureTopic	0	It is on the east side of Cylarne, which we hold for Lord Sheogorath. The Aurmazl Kaneh has her command post there.	
FormID: 0007FF5D	SE06	SEAltarofDespairTopic	0	You have found it. The holiest of holies within Cylarne, aside from the altar of the Flame of Agnon itself.	
FormID: 0007FF5E	SE06	SEAltarofDespairTopic	0	We hold the Altar of Despair, here within the Shrine of the Flame of Agnon.	
FormID: 0007FF5E	SE06	SEAltarofDespairTopic	1	Continue down the corridor if you wish to meditate there upon the fate of all things mortal.	
FormID: 0007FF5F	SE06	SEAltarofDespairTopic	0	Alas, we have not seen the Altar of Despair for many years. It is in the underground part of Cylarne, which is controlled by the Mazken.	
FormID: 0007FF5F	SE06	SEAltarofDespairTopic	1	The Mazken do not even allow us free passage to worship there, which is one of the many reasons why they are unfit to continue to guard it.	
FormID: 000805A8	SE05	SE05TortureChoice2F	0	No, please no....	
FormID: 000805A7	SE05	SE05TortureChoice1F	0	Please, no!	
FormID: 000805F0	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask	0	Really, Inquisitor. Are you not supposed to be the one in charge here? I can't do all your work for you.	disappointed, slightly creepy
FormID: 0008E336	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask	0	You have what you need, don't you? Time to seek out Muurine, I think.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 0008E505	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask	0	Nelrene caved in, finally, but we'll need something more to get to the bottom of this. Let's see if Ma'zaddha provides us with more evidence.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 0008E506	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask	0	Ma'zaddha was able to provide some useful evidence, even if he did not survive to see it put to use. It's time to confront Nelrene again.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 0008E507	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask	0	Nelrene is clearly withholding information. Persuasion might be in order, or perhaps Ma'zaddha will have something that will help.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 0008E508	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask	0	You have a few options, I believe. Either wait for Ma'zaddha to return with more information, or have a chat with Nelrene in the meantime.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 0008E511	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask	0	You've heard Ma'zaddha. Isn't it time to confront him with that fact?	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 0008E512	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask	0	Your task now is to listen in on Ma'zaddha's conversation with Nelrene without being noticed.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 0008E512	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask	1	It hasn't worked very well so far, but I have no doubt that you will persevere, Inquisitor.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 0008E337	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask	0	Ma'zaddha is meeting Nelrene at night. How illicit!	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 0008E337	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask	1	Make every effort to be present for this conversation. It may give us something to hold over Ma'zaddha and get him to talk.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 000805F1	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask	0	Ma'zaddha is reluctant to speak to you, and I assume there's good reason. It would be worth finding another way to get him to talk.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 000805F1	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask	1	There must be someone in Crucible who knows more. We should talk to more people about what's going on.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 0008567D	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask	0	Anya claims to have been approached by Ma'zaddha. Perhaps there's something to this after all.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 0008567D	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask	1	We should find him soon. If he knows something, it might be a key to what's going on in Crucible.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 00083F4D	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask	0	It would seem that Anya Herrick may know something. It could be nothing, but it's certainly worth following up on, don't you think?	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 00083F4D	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask	1	We should have a little chat with her as soon as possible. I look forward to it; I get the feeling she avoids me at times.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 00083F4F	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask	0	As we're just starting out, we need to find a place to start. Someone who knows something.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 00083F4F	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask	1	We may have to torture dozens of people before we find one who knows something. How exciting!	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 00083F4F	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask	2	I shall follow you through Crucible. Speak with the citizens, and ask what they know about this supposed conspiracy.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 000805F2	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateWho	0	Inquisitor, I am surprised that you do not have a better grasp on the situation. This is most disappointing.	disappointed, slightly creepy
FormID: 000805F3	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateWho	0	You have the evidence you need. It's time to bring in Muurine.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 0008E504	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateWho	0	Nelrene is lying to you, Inquisitor. She knows more than she tells. You should address that as soon as possible.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 0008E513	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateWho	0	Ma'zaddha has been most helpful! We'll have to see what he comes back with. In the meantime, you might consider speaking with Nelrene.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 0008E338	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateWho	0	After overhearing Ma'zaddha and Nelrene, I'd say you have quite a card to play the next time you speak with him.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 0008E338	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateWho	1	I certainly look forward to that interaction.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 00083F39	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateWho	0	If Ma'zaddha has indeed been consulting with Nelrene of her Ladyship's guard, that would provide us with some excellent leverage.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 00083F39	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateWho	1	If the two meet regularly, you might have a chance to eavesdrop and learn more about what's going on.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 00083F49	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateWho	0	Ma'zaddha is clearly withholding something. It would seem that direct pressure has no effect, so we'll have to try another route.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 00083F49	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateWho	1	Perhaps we can convince someone else in Crucible to tell us a bit more about his recent activities. That might loosen his tongue.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 00083F4A	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateWho	0	According to Miss Herrick, Ma'zaddha has been pressuring her. He would be our next target, if you will.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 00083F4C	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateWho	0	Anya Herrick, dear Inquisitor. She's been named as someone of interest. I do look forward to chatting with her, don't you?	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 00083F50	SE05	SE05HerdirInvestigateWho	0	I don't know! Isn't that wonderful? It could be any of them... All of them, perhaps. We'll just have to start torturing people to find out!	delighted, slightly creepy
FormID: 000805EF	SE05	SE05Investigation	0	What would you like to know, Inquisitor?	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 000805EC	SE05	SE05HerdirNevermind	0	Very well, Inquisitor.	
FormID: 000805EE	SE05	SE05HerdirBeginChoice2	0	Isn't it obvious? We need to search through Crucible, looking for these traitors. Talk to whomever might have information.	
FormID: 000805EE	SE05	SE05HerdirBeginChoice2	1	If they're reluctant to help, you just say the word and I'll do my best to persuade them.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 000805EE	SE05	SE05HerdirBeginChoice2	2	Really, we should be going. Her Ladyship expects results!	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 000805ED	SE05	SE05HerdirBeginChoice1	0	Ah, I do appreciate an assertive leader. I look forward to working with you on this assignment. Lead the way, Grand Inquisitor!	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 000805E9	SE05	SE05HerdirGreetChoice3	0	As you wish. Do come back and see me some time.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 000805EB	SE05	SE05HerdirGreetChoice2	0	Are you? Hmm. I'd expected an entrance with a bit more flair. Ah, well. Perhaps you'll grow into the role. One can hope, eh?	disappointed, slightly creepy
FormID: 000805EB	SE05	SE05HerdirGreetChoice2	1	Now, we've much to do. Lady Syl is not a patient woman, as I'm sure you've seen. Shall we begin?	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 000805EA	SE05	SE05HerdirGreetChoice1	0	That's rather forward of you, don't you think? We've only just met and already you're ordering me around...	surprised but cheery
FormID: 000805EA	SE05	SE05HerdirGreetChoice1	1	I must say, I enjoy this take-charge attitude. I presume you are the Grand Inquisitor, then? Lady Syl said she'd be appointing someone.	cheery and slightly creepy
FormID: 000805EA	SE05	SE05HerdirGreetChoice1	2	Shall we get to work? There's much to be done. So many people to visit.	cheery and slightly creepy

FormID: 000807BA	SE03Fin	SE03FinKnightsofOrder	0	There isn't much more to say about these soulless creatures. No one knows why they invade or where they're from, but they aren't from the Isles.	
FormID: 000807BA	SE03Fin	SE03FinKnightsofOrder	1	They haven't walked among us in many hundreds of years. Now that they've returned, there's no telling what may happen to us.	
FormID: 000807BA	SE03Fin	SE03FinKnightsofOrder	2	My best advice is to destroy them on sight. They wouldn't hesitate to do the same to you.

FormID: 000807B9	SE03A	SE03AWhatWere	1	Those [QUOTE]beings[QUOTE] as you call them aren't beings at all. They are the soulless abominations known as the Knights of Order.	
FormID: 000807B9	SE03A	SE03AWhatWere	2	Their attraction to the Resonator isn't surprising; it was built from one of the obelisks that dot the Isles they seem to have an affinity for.	
FormID: 000807B9	SE03A	SE03AWhatWere	3	You must proceed to Sheogorath at once and tell him the Knights have returned! Quickly now... go!

FormID: 00080D7A	SE05	SE05AnyaWhat	1	I would be far too afraid to turn on Syl. But I couldn't turn them in, either, because they might come after me. Please, you must do something!	scared, timid, pleading for help
FormID: 00080D7B	SE05	SE05AnyaWho	0	It was Ma'zaddha. He said he was working on behalf of someone else. He told me I needed to help him, or there would be repercussions.	scared, timid
FormID: 00080D7B	SE05	SE05AnyaWho	1	I didn't know what to do. Turning on Syl could cost me my life, but if I don't help, what will Ma'zaddha do to me? You must do something!	scared, timid, pleading for help

FormID: 00081ED4	SE46	SE46DoublesTopic	0	Killed the other one, huh? You're annoying, but you do good work.	
FormID: 00081ED5	SE46	SE46DoublesTopic	0	You're still annoying me, but not as much as the other J'zidzo.	
FormID: 0008FA91	SE46	SE46DoublesTopic	0	I don't like you, but I hate that other J'zidzo more. Those Manics are crazy. Crazy!	
FormID: 0008FA91	SE46	SE46DoublesTopic	1	Make yourself useful. Talk with Horkvir. The proper Horkvir. He runs this place.	
FormID: 00081EF3	SE46	SE46DoublesTopic	0	You've gotten rid of the other one? Fantastic. I can finally get back to my book.	
FormID: 00081EF4	SE46	SE46DoublesTopic	0	Sure would be nice to read something about the other Atrabhi. Like an epitaph.	
FormID: 0008FA9A	SE46	SE46DoublesTopic	0	I can't concentrate on my reading with that other version of me walking around. It's terrible. A curse!	
FormID: 0008FA9A	SE46	SE46DoublesTopic	1	Talk to Horkvir. Our Horkvir. He's in charge. He'll know what to do.	
FormID: 00081EF5	SE46	SE46DoublesTopic	0	I didn't hear you killed the other Atrabhi. And I'm not happy about it.	
FormID: 00081EF6	SE46	SE46DoublesTopic	0	I sure am glad that other Atrabhi is around! I sure don't want her dead!	
FormID: 0008FA9E	SE46	SE46DoublesTopic	0	I love the other Atrabhi! And I certainly wouldn't be happy if you killed her. Really. I wouldn't be happy at all. If she were dead. I swear.	
FormID: 0008FA9E	SE46	SE46DoublesTopic	1	Don't talk to Horkvir about it. He won't know anything. Especially not our Horkvir.	
FormID: 00081EF7	SE46	SE46DoublesTopic	0	Good work, you fuzzy little rascal! We don't need another Urul around. Do we? Do we?	
FormID: 00081F15	SE46	SE46DoublesTopic	0	I sure don't like him! No I don't, you fuzzy little sweetiepie!	
FormID: 0008FAA8	SE46	SE46DoublesTopic	0	You're a cute little bunny! Not like that other Urul here in Split. A sweet thing like you might be able to help.	
FormID: 0008FAA8	SE46	SE46DoublesTopic	1	You should talk to Horkvir. He knows what to do. Not their Horkvir... our Horkvir. I don't like the other one. Or any of them.	
FormID: 00081F16	SE46	SE46DoublesTopic	0	You've killed my double? Good work. Now, please... just leave me alone. I taste terrible.	
FormID: 00081F8C	SE46	SE46DoublesTopic	0	He's got to go. Before he eats me.	
FormID: 0008FB69	SE46	SE46DoublesTopic	0	My double is out to get me. And eat me. You wouldn't do that, would you? Something has to be done.	
FormID: 0008FB69	SE46	SE46DoublesTopic	1	You should ask Horkvir about it. Our Horkvir. Not the other one. He'd lie to you, I'm sure.	
FormID: 00082426	SE38	SE38TalkItem12	0	I love this one. It's a Screaming Maw that can't scream! Isn't that just the Oddest thing you've ever seen?	
FormID: 00082427	SE38	SE38TalkItem12	0	Oh, yes, I've already shown you this shelf, haven't I? My poor old brain just isn't what it used to be!	
FormID: 00082428	SE38	SE38TalkItem11	0	The Ring of Disrobing -- removes your clothes if you put it on. Now, don't you go trying it! I have enough Oddities on display already, hahaha.	tittering laughter at the end (she thinks she's made a terribly naughty joke)
FormID: 00082429	SE38	SE38TalkItem11	0	This case here I'm saving for something special. Wouldn't you like to be the one to find something Odd enough to go on display here?	
FormID: 0008242A	SE38	SE38TalkItem10	0	Here's a new addtion to the Museum, one of my favorites. A dagger that heals whomever it cuts! Isn't that deliciously Odd?	
FormID: 0008242B	SE38	SE38TalkItem10	0	Oh. That's strange, I thought there was something else here... well, no matter. Just losing my mind or something! Right this way.	starting puzzled, then to too-cheerful
FormID: 0008242C	SE38	SE38TalkItem9	0	A lovely little Oddity -- a key made from a Hound's Tooth. And no one even knows what it opens, imagine that! Shall we move on?	
FormID: 0008242D	SE38	SE38TalkItem9	0	I think something's missing from this shelf. Or it could be just my old brain playing tricks on me again. Oh well, let's continue the tour, shall we?	starting puzzled, then to too-cheerful
FormID: 0008242E	SE38	SE38TalkItem8	0	This one is perhaps more unusual than truly Odd, but some people enjoy it. Truth be told, I only display it as a favor to the donor.	
FormID: 0008242F	SE38	SE38TalkItem8	0	As you can see, I have plenty of space here for new Oddities, so think of me when you run across anything Odd!	
FormID: 00082430	SE38	SE38TalkItem7	0	Here's something truly Odd -- a Soul Tomato! A tomato that can act like a soul gem! No one has yet been able to explain it.	
FormID: 00082431	SE38	SE38TalkItem7	0	Were you in here last week? Wasn't there an exhibit in this case then? Oh well, I must just be going senile, hahaha!	slightly too-giddy/scary laughter at the end
FormID: 00081EC8	SE38	SE38TalkItem6	0	This is a lovely little Oddity -- a two-headed Septim! Take your time, there's no rush.	
FormID: 00081EC9	SE38	SE38TalkItem6	0	Well, this case seems to be empty. Strange. I'm sure that yesterday... ah, my memory just isn't what it used to be. Let's see what else we can find.	
FormID: 00081EC6	SE38	SE38TalkItem5	0	Here we have the mortal remains of a fellow named Din, who as I understand was driven mad and killed himself, a truly Demented act.	
FormID: 00081EC7	SE38	SE38TalkItem5	0	Yes. I've been meaning to put something here, but it seems I haven't gotten around to it. Although I distinctly remember preparing an exhibit....	
FormID: 00081EC4	SE38	SE38TalkItem4	0	Over here is the Pelvis of Pelagius, the greatest Emperor that Tamriel has ever seen, as well as being completely mad.	
FormID: 00081EC5	SE38	SE38TalkItem4	0	Hmm... I could have sworn that I used to keep something very Odd on this shelf. Oh well. Let's move on.	
FormID: 00081EB9	SENQDDementia	SEOdditiesTourNo	0	That's fine. Feel free to look around on your own.	
FormID: 00081EBA	SENQDDementia	SEOdditiesTourYes	0	Wonderful! Follow me, and I'll show you around my little collection of Oddities.	
FormID: 00081EB8	SENQDDementia	SEOdditiesTourTopic	0	Would you like a tour of the Museum?	
FormID: 0008F58B	SE38	SE38TalkItem3	0	This right here is one of my favorites. A lump of amber in the shape of your head, my Lord! A very popular item, too, if I may be so bold.	simpering a little
FormID: 00081EAF	SE38	SE38TalkItem3	0	This right here is one of my favorites. A lump of amber in the shape of Lord Sheogorath's head! The wonders of nature never cease to amaze.	
FormID: 00081EB7	SE38	SE38TalkItem3	0	This case is waiting for something especially Odd. If you run across anything Odd, be sure to bring it by and it might end up on display here!	
FormID: 00081EB1	SE38	SE38TalkItem2	0	Here in this case is a disgustingly deformed Swamp Tentacle. Such a freak of nature has never been seen before, and hopefully not since either!	
FormID: 00082432	SE38	SE38TalkItem2	0	You know, I always walk over here thinking there's another exhibit, but there never is. Silly me!	
FormID: 00081EB0	SE38	SE38TalkItem1	0	Here you see the Blind Watcher's Eye. A most unusual specimen collected at great peril by... some intrepid adventurer!	
FormID: 00081EB5	SE38	SE38TalkItem1	0	Here is... well, I think there used to be something very Odd here, but it seems to be missing now. Let's move on.	
FormID: 00081EA8	SE38	SE38Oddity12	0	Oh. Another Mute Screaming Maw. I already have one of those on exhibit.	
FormID: 00081EA9	SE38	SE38Oddity12	0	I've been looking for one of those to replace the one I used to have on display. At least I think I did. I truly wish I could afford to buy it...	
FormID: 00081EAA	SE38	SE38Oddity12	0	Oh, how cute! Look how it tries and tries to scream but no sound comes out! This is perfect for my museum!	
FormID: 00081E96	SE38	SE38Oddity11	0	I'm so sorry. I already have a Ring of Disrobing. There's really no place in a Museum of Oddities for duplicates, as I'm sure you can understand.	
FormID: 00081E97	SE38	SE38Oddity11	0	That's just like one that's gone missing from my Museum. If only I had the funds to replace it.	end with a big sigh
FormID: 00081E98	SE38	SE38Oddity11	0	Oh, my. How wonderful! A ring that removes people's clothing! This will be one of my most popular exhibits, I'm sure.	tittering and simpering like a schoolgirl
FormID: 00081E93	SE38	SE38Oddity10	0	That's so strange. I got one of those just the other day. Sorry. Maybe you can start your own collection of oddities, hmm?	
FormID: 00081E94	SE38	SE38Oddity10	0	Oh, yes, I have one of those... no, that's the one that I misplaced the other day. I'd really like to replace it, but funds are so tight...	
FormID: 00081E95	SE38	SE38Oddity10	0	Well isn't that just the Oddest thing! A dagger that heals people. Who would make such a thing, and why? I absolutely adore it!	
FormID: 00081E90	SE38	SE38Oddity9	0	Honestly, I'd never seen one before until recently, and now to have two turn up! That's Odd in itself, isn't it? But I really can't use it, sorry.	
FormID: 00081E91	SE38	SE38Oddity9	0	What luck! I seem to have misplaced the one I used to have on display. I really can't afford to buy it from you though.	
FormID: 00081E92	SE38	SE38Oddity9	0	What a perfect little Oddity! Just strange enough that it makes you go [QUOTE]Hmm?[QUOTE] but not so strange as to become a Miracle or an Omen. Thank you!	
FormID: 00081E8D	SE38	SE38Oddity8	0	We already have one of those, I'm afraid. It wasn't all that Odd to begin with, honestly. We certainly can't have two.	
FormID: 00081E8E	SE38	SE38Oddity8	0	Seems like I've seen one of those before. But I guess it is Odd enough for the Museum... but I certainly can't justify buying it from you.	
FormID: 00081E8F	SE38	SE38Oddity8	0	Hmm. A bowl that you mix potions in. Doesn't seem all that Odd to me... well, I can see you're trying, so I'll find somewhere to put it.	mulling over the idea
FormID: 00081E8A	SE38	SE38Oddity7	0	You wouldn't think there would be two of those in the world, now would you? Sorry. Keep looking and I'm sure something truly Odd will turn up.	
FormID: 00081E8B	SE38	SE38Oddity7	0	That looks just like one I used to have. Or maybe I saw it in a book... in any case, I wish I could afford to buy it from you, but....	
FormID: 00081E8C	SE38	SE38Oddity7	0	Oh my, that is Odd! I've never even heard of such a thing before. We'll find a nice place for it here in the Museum.	
FormID: 00081E87	SE38	SE38Oddity6	0	That's too bad. I already have one of those. Can't very well have two in a Museum of Oddities, now can we?	
FormID: 00081E88	SE38	SE38Oddity6	0	I already have one of... wait a moment, no, that's the one I can't find now. If only I had the money to buy it off you....	
FormID: 00081E89	SE38	SE38Oddity6	0	Two Tibers are always better than one, I always say! We'll take good care of him here in the Museum, don't you worry.	
FormID: 00081E84	SE38	SE38Oddity5	0	Really? But I already have Din's Ashes. I'm afraid someone must have taken advantage of your gullibility.	
FormID: 00081E85	SE38	SE38Oddity5	0	Where did you find that? I was sure I once had Din's Ashes on display here... I wish I had the funds to replace them, they were very popular....	
FormID: 00081E86	SE38	SE38Oddity5	0	This is unsual! The ashes of a famous madman are perfect for my Museum!	emphasis on [QUOTE]this IS unusual[QUOTE]

FormID: 00082094	SE09Misc	SE09VictimChoice3b	0	Are you sure? You will not easily heal the damage done to you. This is a permanent sacrifice you are making. In fact, it is likely you will die.	suprised the player agreed to her terms, and giving him a chance out. She believes he won't really go through with it.
FormID: 00082094	SE09Misc	SE09VictimChoice3b	1	Perhaps you had better reconsider.	suprised the player agreed to her terms, and giving him a chance out. She believes he won't really go through with it.
FormID: 00082093	SE09Misc	SE09VictimChoice3a	0	Then you are a coward, as well as a bigot, and we will speak no more of this.	triumphant. She alwyas knew the player didn't have the conviction of his words.
FormID: 00082092	SE09Misc	SE09VictimChoice2b	0	Out of deference to my Lord Sheogorath, I will allow this outburst. In fact, I will acquiesce to your request.	speaking as if there is a big catch, and joyful that she really doesn't have to go along with it because the player will never agree to it

FormID: 00082092	SE09Misc	SE09VictimChoice2b	2	Are you willing to trade places with these souls, to bear the full weight of their pain and afflictions? Weigh this question carefully.	sudden ominously serious.

FormID: 00082091	SE09Misc	SE09VictimChoice2a	1	I'm glad to see your ego is not larger than your vision. Now, let us talk no more of this.	trying not to sound condescendig, but speaking as if to a child who is finally starting to learn something

FormID: 00082090	SE09Misc	SE09VictimChoice1b	4	And what can you offer the world, except the hot air escaping through that hole in your head?	snide sarcastic, and belittling to the extreme.
FormID: 0008208F	SE09Misc	SE09VictimChoice1a	0	I'm glad you are reasonable and open-minded. Perhaps Sheogorath's faith in you isn't misplaced, after all. Now, let's not speak of this again.	tyring not to be condescending, but as if talking to a child who is finally learning something.
FormID: 00081FDC	SE09Misc	SE09Victims	0	Oh, you mean my research subjects? Don't trouble yourself with their fates. They are volunteers, of one sort or another. 	making light of the fact that these people are suffering greatly, as if they were nothing but labratory rats.

FormID: 0008243B	SE38	SE38OddityC	0	Oh, a Ring of Desiccation! That's one of my... well, was one of my favorite Oddities. If I had the money, I'd buy it off you right now.	
FormID: 0008243A	SE38	SE38OddityB	0	Interesting. I could have sworn I used to have an arm like that in my museum. I have just the place for it, if only I could afford to buy it....	
FormID: 00082439	SE38	SE38OddityA	0	Oh, that looks just like a little skull I used to have. I would love to have one back, but the Museum just isn't drawing the crowds anymore....	
FormID: 00082438	SE38	SE38TalkItemDone	0	I hope you've enjoyed the tour! Feel free to stay and browse for as long as you like.	
FormID: 00082436	SE38	SE38TalkItemC	0	Up here is a little beauty. The Ring of Desiccation. Walk on water and breathe underwater at the same time. Odd, if you think about it for a minute.	
FormID: 00082437	SE38	SE38TalkItemC	0	Here's the Ring of... well now, where did it go? Things have a way of disappearing around here that's enough to drive a person insane!	
FormID: 00082434	SE38	SE38TalkItemB	0	Here's a real Oddity for you -- an arm of one of the Gatekeepers! This one was killed by... oh, I forget now. A lovely specimen in any case.	
FormID: 00082435	SE38	SE38TalkItemB	0	Hmm. You haven't seen a huge severed arm with an axe for a hand anywhere, have you? I seem to have misplaced mine. Ah, well.	
FormID: 00081EB6	SE38	SE38TalkItemA	0	Look closely and you'll see a tiny skull. These pygmys used to live in the Shivering Isles until they were all eaten by Grummites, poor dears!	
FormID: 00082433	SE38	SE38TalkItemA	0	There used to be a pygmy skull here, I was sure of it. My very first Oddity. I couldn't have imagined that, could I? ... Well, let's move on!	
FormID: 00082466	SE07	SE07SheoIntro3	0	Now? You'll need the respect of My citizens. They'll need a leader, someone to look up to when I'm gone. They're the backbone of any great land.	
FormID: 00082466	SE07	SE07SheoIntro3	1	Except where the backbone is an actual backbone. Ever been to Malacath's realm...? Nasty stuff. But, back to the business at hand.	
FormID: 00082466	SE07	SE07SheoIntro3	2	You'll need to control one of the Courts of Madness. Replace a current Duke. Or Duchess. Whichever. That will command respect!	
FormID: 00082466	SE07	SE07SheoIntro3	3	The people will rally around you. You'll have their love, their admiration, their complaints! Whatever. As long as it keeps them on Our side.	
FormID: 00082468	SE07	SE07SheoIntro2	0	Why not? Something has to work. Once, I dug a pit and filled it with clouds. Or was it clowns? Doesn't matter. It didn't slow him down.	
FormID: 00082468	SE07	SE07SheoIntro2	1	To be honest, it wasn't the best idea. And it really began to smell. Must have been clowns. Clouds don't smell bad. They taste of butter! And tears.	
FormID: 00082468	SE07	SE07SheoIntro2	2	But, this is all new! A fresh idea! Something I hadn't thought of, until I did. It's sure to work, even though it might not.	
FormID: 00082467	SE07	SE07SheoIntro1	0	The Greymarch is upon us, and the Ordering begins. Armies of Order sweep My Realm. Death. Destruction. Then I have to pick up the pieces.	
FormID: 00082467	SE07	SE07SheoIntro1	1	And there are always lots of pieces.	
FormID: 00082467	SE07	SE07SheoIntro1	2	I don't like it, having to rebuild My Realm every era. Sometimes I forget where things go. Like New Sheoth. I can never remember where it belongs....	
FormID: 00082467	SE07	SE07SheoIntro1	3	You'll change that. Break the cycle. You'll stop Jyggalag, and I'll have My Realm to come back to. I've never actually tried that before.	
FormID: 00082461	SE06	SE06SheoIntro5	0	Now... you've seen the Great Torch that burns brightly over New Sheoth? No? Because it doesn't. It should. But it doesn't. You'll fix that.	
FormID: 00082461	SE06	SE06SheoIntro5	1	You'll go to Cylarne and bring back the Flame of Agnon to relight the torch. Oh... and take care with my minions at Cylarne.	
FormID: 00082461	SE06	SE06SheoIntro5	2	In their eternal quest to please me, they're constantly fighting over Cylarne. It can be tiresome. But, really, it's divine. Divinely tiresome.	
FormID: 00082461	SE06	SE06SheoIntro5	3	Well. That's your problem now. Off with you. I don't want to see you again until the Great Torch is lit. I wouldn't want to have to hurt you. Much.	
FormID: 00082461	SE06	SE06SheoIntro5	4	Oh, don't forget to make use of dear Haskill. Between you and me, if he's not summoned three or four times a day, I don't think he feels appreciated.	
FormID: 00082465	SE06	SE06SheoIntro4	0	Not here. Didn't I say that? I'm never here when Jyggalag walks. It's one of the Rules.	
FormID: 00082465	SE06	SE06SheoIntro4	1	I've told you too much for now. Listen to me prattle on. I can see your mortal brain straining. We'll talk more later.	
FormID: 00082464	SE06	SE06SheoIntro3	0	Because you seem a nice enough sort. And you've made it this far.	
FormID: 00082464	SE06	SE06SheoIntro3	1	And if you don't, I'll swallow your soul and vomit it into the Everfilling Chamberpot of the Ageless.	
FormID: 00082464	SE06	SE06SheoIntro3	2	But mostly because I asked nicely.	
FormID: 00082463	SE06	SE06SheoIntro2	0	A fair question. You won't, really. At least I don't think so. But you'll have power. My power. Try not to lose it. It's a pain to replace.	
FormID: 00082463	SE06	SE06SheoIntro2	1	But, for all intents and purposes, you'll be Me. A Me to fight the Him. Since I won't be around. It's simple, really. If you don't think about it.

FormID: 000852C2	DarkConversations	Dark08NelsNevConvo	0	I'm going to open a tavern. Not that I'd welcome your patronage. No pigs allowed inside, you see. You Legion types tend to stink up a place.  	
FormID: 000852C3	DarkConversations	Dark08NelsNevConvo	0	A tavern! Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, I should have known! Leave it to a barbarian to spend an entire chest full of gold on beer and mead. How pathetic.	
FormID: 000852C4	DarkConversations	Dark08NelsNevConvo	0	You can call me a barbarian. It's true and I'm proud of the fact. But you call me pathetic again and I'm going to show you just how barbaric I am.

FormID: 0008C21F	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	If you are truly the hero of destiny, as I hope, the Garden will not hold you for long.	
FormID: 0008C220	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	Lift your eyes to Carac Agaialor, my seat at the pinnacle of Paradise. I shall await you there.	
FormID: 0008C221	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	How little you understand!	
FormID: 0008C224	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	The Principalities have sparkled as gems in the black reaches of Oblivion since the First Morning.	
FormID: 0008C226	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	Many are their names and the names of their masters: the Coldharbour of Meridia, Peryrite's Quagmire, the ten Moonshadows of Mephala, and...	
FormID: 0008C227	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	... and Dawn's Beauty, the Princedom of Lorkhan... misnamed 'Tamriel' by deluded mortals.	
FormID: 0008C228	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	Yes, you understand now.	
FormID: 0008C229	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	Tamriel is just one more Daedric realm of Oblivion, long since lost to its Prince when he was betrayed by those that served him.	
FormID: 0008C22A	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	Lord Dagon cannot invade Tamriel, his birthright! He comes to liberate the Occupied Lands!	
FormID: 0008C22B	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	Ask yourself! How is it that mighty gods die, yet the Daedra stand incorruptible?	
FormID: 0008C22C	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	How is it that the Daedra forthrightly proclaim themselves to man, while the gods cower behind statues and the faithless words of traitor-priests?	
FormID: 0008C22D	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	It is simple... they are not gods at all.	
FormID: 0008C22E	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	The truth has been in front of you since first you were born: the Daedra are the true gods of this universe.	
FormID: 0008C22F	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	Julianos and Dibella and Stendarr are all Lorkhan's betrayers, posing as divinities in a principality that has lost its guiding light. 	
FormID: 0008C230	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	What are Scholarship, Love, and Mercy when compared to Fate, Night, and Destruction? The gods you worship are trifling shadows of First Causes.	
FormID: 0008C231	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	They have tricked you for Ages.	
FormID: 0008C233	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	Why do you think your world has always been contested ground, the arena of powers and immortals?	
FormID: 0008C23D	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	It is Tamriel, the realm of Change, brother to Madness, sister to Deceit.	
FormID: 0008C23E	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	Your false gods could not entirely rewrite history. Thus you remember tales of Lorkhan, vilified, a dead trickster, whose heart came to Tamriel.	
FormID: 0008C23F	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	But if a god can die, how does his heart survive?	
FormID: 0008C240	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	He is daedroth! TAMRIEL AE DAEDROTH!

FormID: 0008C243	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	Well done, champion! Your progress is swift and sure. Perhaps you will reach me after all.

FormID: 0008C247	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	I welcome you, if you truly are the agent of Fate.	
FormID: 0008C248	MQ15	MQ15MankarRant	0	I tire of the self-styled heroes who set themselves in my path, only to prove unworthy in the event.	
FormID: 0008C25E	DAPeryite	DAPeryiteSpeech	0	Perhaps they have learned the folly of attempting to touch a Daedra Prince. Take this, with my blessing. May it bring you order.	
FormID: 0008DD57	DAPeryite	DAPeryiteSpeech	0	You have returned my followers, mortal. The natural order is restored, and for this, I thank you.	
FormID: 0008DD5E	DAPeryite	DAPeryiteSpeech	0	Return to me when you are prepared.	
FormID: 0008DD60	DAPeryite	DAPeryiteSpeech	0	I will transport you to the plane of Oblivion in which they are trapped. Find their souls. When all are collected, I will return you here.	
FormID: 0008C25F	DAPeryite	DAPeryiteSpeech	0	My followers are trapped between worlds; their bodies here on this plane, their souls in Oblivion. I would have you reunite the bodies and the souls.	
FormID: 0008C260	DAPeryite	DAPeryiteSpeech	0	The fools cast a spell in the hopes of summoning me to them. It was prideful and foolish, and it has had its consequences. 	
FormID: 0008C268	DAPeryite	DAPeryiteSpeech	0	This one moves! A welcome change. So, mortal, you have found my shrine, and you have seen my followers. They are an embarrassment to me.

FormID: 0008E55C	SENQDDementia	SEHillofSuicidesTopic	0	Maybe you can help the others. Watch out for Them.	
FormID: 0008E55D	SENQDDementia	SEHillofSuicidesTopic	0	You've found Gadeneri's skull? Take it to her at the Hill of Suicides! Before They find out you've got it!	
FormID: 0008E55E	SENQDDementia	SEHillofSuicidesTopic	0	It's where you end up if you don't die according to His plan. They will drive you to it. Like They did poor Gadeneri.	
FormID: 0008E55E	SENQDDementia	SEHillofSuicidesTopic	1	I loved her, and then she was gone. By her own hand. It's said any soul on the Hill can be released if their remains are brought to them.	
FormID: 0008E55E	SENQDDementia	SEHillofSuicidesTopic	2	I've heard that those that free the souls become blessed. Can't say for sure. They scatter the remains all over the Isles. Bastards.	
FormID: 0008E94A	SE03	SE03XedilianTopic	0	Yes, quite an amazing place really. Wonderful for relieving one's tension as you watch those troublesome adventurers suffer... no offence.	Pompus
FormID: 0008E94A	SE03	SE03XedilianTopic	1	I'd say your next move is to head to Xedilian and get it reactivated.	
FormID: 0008E945	SE03	SE03XedilianTopic	0	I'd suggest you make haste and get to Xedilian. My Lord Sheogorath does not like those who lollygag. Or maybe He does? Bah! Just get going.	
FormID: 0008E94D	SE03	SE03XedilianTopic	0	A little busy here! I'm trying to decide what to have for dinner. Oh, how I love eating. One of my favorite things to do.	
FormID: 0008E94D	SE03	SE03XedilianTopic	1	Talk to Haskill if you need more information. He's got more brains than a brain pie. Oh... Brain pie! Perfect!	
FormID: 0008E94D	SE03	SE03XedilianTopic	2	Care to donate?	
FormID: 0008E94B	SE03	SE03Reactivated	0	Yes? Ah... silly me. The book has no pictures. Can't really expect you to read that, now can I?	Pompus and a bit irritated.
FormID: 0008E94B	SE03	SE03Reactivated	1	To reactivate Xedilian for my Lord's pleasure, you'll need to find three Focus Crystals and return them to their resting place.	
FormID: 0008E94B	SE03	SE03Reactivated	2	Each crystal has a matching receptacle called a Judgment Nexus. Even you can't miss them.	Pompus and a bit dismissive
FormID: 0008E94B	SE03	SE03Reactivated	3	Without the crystals in place, the Resonator of Judgment, Xedilian's power source, cannot be restored.	
FormID: 0008E944	SE03	SE03Reactivated	0	You have the Attenuator, the Manual, and a map. I'm certainly not going to carry you there, so I'd suggest you get to it.	Pompus

FormID: 0008EA8B	SE03A	SE03LewinC1Idle01	0	Can we just leave? I don't like the looks of this place.	Nervous
FormID: 0008EA8D	SE03A	SE03LewinC1Idle01	0	That thing may be small but it looks mean. Let's get out of here.	Nervous
FormID: 0008EA9A	SE03A	SE03SyndelC1Idle01	0	Curious. This one is smaller than the others we've encountered.	Intrigued and logical.

FormID: 0008FAB8	SE46	SE46Choice1	1	So, what does he do? What else? Casts a spell. You can see how well that went. Two of each of us walking around this place.	
FormID: 0008FAB8	SE46	SE46Choice1	2	Nothing we can do about it, either. There's a law about that here. Been to the Hill of Suicides? Not a nice place. But you might be able to help.

FormID: 0009120D	SE07	SE07JyggalagTopic	0	I fear it won't be long until he makes his presence known. Without Sheogorath on His throne, the Realm is likely doomed. Again.	
FormID: 00091016	SE07B	SE07GreymarchTopic	0	It'll be in full swing soon! Excited?	
FormID: 00091016	SE07B	SE07GreymarchTopic	1	You shouldn't be. It's the death of all things.

FormID: 000910FC	SE07	SE07GreymarchTopic	0	It's already started, but you might be able to stop it. We're making you into a leader the people can trust. Someone to look up to. Someone to blame!	
FormID: 000910FC	SE07	SE07GreymarchTopic	1	Once I'm gone, things usually get bad quickly. Lots of defections. Lots of carnage. But with you at the helm, things will be different!	
FormID: 0009112B	SE07	SE07GreymarchTopic	0	It seems our Lord believes you are the key to stopping it. Perhaps He's right. He's had worse ideas. Did he tell you about the clowns? What a mess.	
FormID: 0009112B	SE07	SE07GreymarchTopic	1	He wishes you to gain the respect of the people, to be a leader once He is gone. It is an interesting concept.	;emphasis on [QUOTE]interesting.[QUOTE] He's not buying this for a second
FormID: 000910F7	SE06	SE06PriestsOrderTopic	0	They're the worst of all. My own subjects, working for the Enemy! It's enough to make an old Daedric Prince get all weepy.	
FormID: 000910F7	SE06	SE06PriestsOrderTopic	1	It doesn't help that they're the ones who make the obelisks work. A little chanting, a little ritual, and POOF! Knights of Order. Bad news.	
FormID: 000910F7	SE06	SE06PriestsOrderTopic	2	Kill them when you see them. But don't touch the corpse until they're really dead. Which they aren't, until you deactivate the obelisk.	
FormID: 000910F9	SE06	SE06PriestsOrderTopic	0	A bad lot. Traitors. You'll find them near the obelisks that dot the land. They perform rituals at the obelisks to summon Knights to the Realm.	
FormID: 000910F9	SE06	SE06PriestsOrderTopic	1	Their link to Jyggalag gives them power. As long as their obelisk is active, they cannot truly be killed.	
FormID: 000910F6	SE06	SE06JyggalagTopic	0	He's on his way, so I'm on my way out. It's terribly inconvenient, don't you think?	
FormID: 000910F6	SE06	SE06JyggalagTopic	1	You're going to stop him, though. And the first thing to do is to make my people feel safe. Otherwise, they tend to go work for him.	
FormID: 000910F6	SE06	SE06JyggalagTopic	2	It's annoying, to tell the truth. A bit hurtful. But they do it every time. Join up with the enemy, and become Priests of Order.	
FormID: 000910F8	SE06	SE06JyggalagTopic	0	Yes, he will soon march across the land, destroying all that stands in his path. It's a frightening prospect.	
FormID: 000910F8	SE06	SE06JyggalagTopic	1	Many of our citizens are... delicate. They can't cope with the prospect, and they defect to the forces of Jyggalag, becoming Priests of Order.	
FormID: 000910FA	SE06	SE06ObelisksTopic	0	They're getting more active every day. Not a good sign.	
FormID: 000910FA	SE06	SE06ObelisksTopic	1	You know what would be a good sign? [QUOTE]Free Sweetrolls![QUOTE] Who wouldn't like that?	
FormID: 000910FA	SE06	SE06ObelisksTopic	2	Shut them down where you can. And make sure to kill the Priests you see around them. If you don't, they can reactivate the obelisk.	
FormID: 000910FB	SE06	SE06ObelisksTopic	0	I fear they grow in power as the Greymarch progresses. More and more Knights of Order make their way into the Isles.	
FormID: 000910FB	SE06	SE06ObelisksTopic	1	The Priests of Order are the key. They summon the Knights at the obelisks.

FormID: 000910ED	SE06	SE06GreymarchTopic	2	You're going to stop the Greymarch by becoming Me. Or a version of Me. You'll be powerful. Powerful enough to stop Jyggalag.	
FormID: 000910F5	SE06	SE06GreymarchTopic	0	It is underway, but my Lord does not wish for you to confront it directly yet. First, the Realm and its citizens must be attended to.	
FormID: 000910A0	SE06	SE06GreatTorchTopic	0	The Great Torch shines brightly above New Sheoth, a beacon of hope for all the citizens.	
FormID: 000910A0	SE06	SE06GreatTorchTopic	1	Except it doesn't! It's gone out. Happens every time the Greymarch begins. Which it has.	
FormID: 000910A0	SE06	SE06GreatTorchTopic	2	Makes all of my subjects uneasy. Tense. Homicidal. Some of them, at least. We need to get that Torch relit, before the place falls apart.	
FormID: 000910A9	SE06	SE06GreatTorchTopic	0	Ah, the Great Torch. It is a symbol of Sheogorath's power and a source of great comfort for the citizens of New Sheoth.	
FormID: 000910A9	SE06	SE06GreatTorchTopic	1	Unfortunately, the Torch has gone out. For eternity, this has heralded the start of the Greymarch.	
FormID: 000910A9	SE06	SE06GreatTorchTopic	2	Lord Sheogorath, in His wisdom, wishes for you to relight the Torch, to help ease the worries of the populace.	
FormID: 00091020	SE04Shell	SE04GreymarchTopic	0	As my Lord told you, it happens at the end of every era, and Jyggalag walks the Realm.	
FormID: 00091020	SE04Shell	SE04GreymarchTopic	1	Few of the citizens can remember the last Greymarch. Or they choose not to.	
FormID: 00091021	SE04Shell	SE04GreymarchTopic	0	It's Jyggalag's time, and not a good time at all. You're going to help me stop it. First, though, you need to get your feet wet.	
FormID: 00091021	SE04Shell	SE04GreymarchTopic	1	I can't expect you to save the place if you don't even understand it. So, speak to my Dukes. Learn about Mania and Dementia. Try not to die.	
FormID: 00091018	SE04Shell	SE04JyggalagTopic	0	The Daedric Prince of Order, and the leader of the Greymarch. As I'm sure my Lord told you, Jyggalag has always been a threat to this Realm.	
FormID: 0009102C	SE04Shell	SE04JyggalagTopic	0	Another Daedric Prince. Not a nice one. I don't think ANY of the other Princes like him, actually. I mean, Malacath is more popular at parties.	
FormID: 0009102C	SE04Shell	SE04JyggalagTopic	1	And Malacath is NOT popular at parties.	
FormID: 0009102D	SE04Shell	SE04ObelisksTopic	0	Seen them about, have you? Odd things. They've always been here, but they're not OF here, if you take my meaning.	
FormID: 0009102D	SE04Shell	SE04ObelisksTopic	1	You'll see those Knights of Order around them during the Greymarch. Drawn to them, like flies to honey. Or rotting flesh.	
FormID: 0009102D	SE04Shell	SE04ObelisksTopic	2	Ever wonder why flies like both? Best not to ask.	
FormID: 00091059	SE04Shell	SE04ObelisksTopic	0	Yes, you'll find them throughout the Isles. Jyggalag's forces use them as conduits into the Isles.	
FormID: 00091059	SE04Shell	SE04ObelisksTopic	1	Sheogorath has tried to remove them, but they always return. While they cannot be destroyed, they can be rendered inert.	
FormID: 00091059	SE04Shell	SE04ObelisksTopic	2	The Hearts of Order found on Jyggalag's Knights can be placed in the obelisks. Adding enough can cause the obelisk to become overloaded with power.	
FormID: 0009101D	SE03	SE03GreymarchTopic	0	Really, no need to trouble yourself with the details of that now. It would just cloud your little mind.	
FormID: 0009101D	SE03	SE03GreymarchTopic	1	What is important is getting to Xedilian. Quickly. Before I get bored. You wouldn't like me when I'm bored.	
FormID: 00091914	Dark10Sanctuary	UniqueSummoningTopic	0	You of course recall Rufio, the feeble old man I sent you to kill when we first met? He was weak in life, but his spirit is quite angry in death.    	Lucien Lachance -- sinister

FormID: 000A5608	MS27	MS27HerminiaF1	0	My crown, the one Umbacano covets, belonged to the ruler of Nenalata.	
FormID: 000A5608	MS27	MS27HerminiaF1	1	I've learned of another crown, entombed with the last ruler of the rival city of Lindai.	
FormID: 000A5608	MS27	MS27HerminiaF1	2	Since Umbacano has never laid eyes on the real Crown of the Ayleids, I doubt he could tell the difference.	
FormID: 000A5608	MS27	MS27HerminiaF1	3	In any case, the other is also a real Ayleid Crown... just not the right one.	
FormID: 000A5608	MS27	MS27HerminiaF1	4	I think we could all sleep better if you brought him Lindai's crown instead of the Crown of Nenalata.	
FormID: 000A5608	MS27	MS27HerminiaF1	5	Here. I happen to have the key you'll need to enter the royal burial chamber in Lindai. I hope you'll make the right choice.	
FormID: 000A5607	MS27	MS27HerminiaE1	0	My own research into the Late Ayleid Period suggests that there was not a single Ayleid ruler, but many.	
FormID: 000A5607	MS27	MS27HerminiaE1	1	They were a bitterly divided people, with many warlords vying against each other for power.	
FormID: 000A5607	MS27	MS27HerminiaE1	2	Their ultimate demise was wrought by their own civil strife at least as much as by the rebellion of their human slaves.	
FormID: 000A5606	MS27	MS27HerminiaD2	0	You're right. Even if I persuade you, he'll send someone else, someone less amenable to reason.	
FormID: 000A5606	MS27	MS27HerminiaD2	1	But what if... what if you brought him another Ayleid Crown?	
FormID: 000A5605	MS27	MS27HerminiaD1	0	Yes. I understand. He wants an Ayleid Crown. But does it have to be my Ayleid Crown? What if you brought him... another crown?	
FormID: 000A5604	MS27	MS27HerminiaC1	0	I'm afraid I don't know for sure. I wish I had a more persuasive answer, but hear me out.	
FormID: 000A5604	MS27	MS27HerminiaC1	1	The Crown of the Ayleids which Umbacano wants is not simply an ancient work of art.	
FormID: 000A5604	MS27	MS27HerminiaC1	2	It has certain superficial magic powers, true, but its real power is hidden.	
FormID: 000A5604	MS27	MS27HerminiaC1	3	However, my studies of the ancient texts make clear that it is the key to dangerous magical powers which should be left dormant.	
FormID: 000A5603	MS27	MS27HerminiaB2	0	You may think so, in your ignorance. But I take a larger view. As a scholar of the Ayleids, I have no wish to see their evil power return.	
FormID: 000A5602	MS27	MS27HerminiaA3	0	So, Umbacano has resorted to hired thugs now?	
FormID: 000A5602	MS27	MS27HerminiaA3	1	If you think me defenseless, you may be surprised. I'm more dangerous than I look.	
FormID: 000A5602	MS27	MS27HerminiaA3	2	Perhaps you could overpower me and take the Crown. Perhaps. But I urge you to reconsider.	
FormID: 000A5602	MS27	MS27HerminiaA3	3	In the wrong hands, the Crown of the Ayleids could be very dangerous. And Umbacano is definitely the wrong hands.	
FormID: 000A5601	MS27	MS27HerminiaB1	0	Far from it. His interest in the Ayleids is not that of a mere scholar. He hopes to unlock the secrets of their magical power.	
FormID: 000A5601	MS27	MS27HerminiaB1	1	And if you know anything about Ayleid-ruled Cyrodiil, that should make you very uneasy.	
FormID: 000A5600	MS27	MS27HerminiaA2	0	I will never allow the Crown to fall into Umbacano's hands. He is far more dangerous than you realize.	
FormID: 000A55FF	MS27	MS27HerminiaA1	0	Save your breath. He's the only one who knows I have it. He's tried to get it from me for years.	
FormID: 000A55FF	MS27	MS27HerminiaA1	1	I will never allow the Crown to fall into Umbacano's hands. He is far more dangerous than you realize.

FormID: 000A6583	MS27	MS27UmbacanoD1	0	In order to bring my research on the last king of the Ayleids to its final stage, I need to go to the Throne Room of Nenalata.	
FormID: 000A6583	MS27	MS27UmbacanoD1	1	While I am not without means of defending myself, I believe you would be an invaluable companion on such an expedition.	
FormID: 000A6583	MS27	MS27UmbacanoD1	2	Your reward will be whatever plunder you wish to carry off from Nenalata.	
FormID: 000A6583	MS27	MS27UmbacanoD1	3	Since the Throne Room has been sealed since the time of the Ayleids, it should provide rich pickings.	
FormID: 000A6585	MS27	MS27UmbacanoC3	0	Then why do you interrupt me? You will not find the Crown here. Begone.	
FormID: 000A6584	MS27	MS27UmbacanoC2	0	Interesting... these markings are unexpected... the royal glyph is not as described by Sorcalin...

FormID: 001778CF	MS48	MS48IlendA1	1	Alright. I'll try to get out of here and let the Captain know what's going on.	
FormID: 001778E2	Dark00GeneralNPC	AdamusPhillidaTopic	0	The old man? Ha! He's easy to protect. Every day's the same. He vists the Coast Guard station, goes for a swim... never puts himself in harm's way. 	
FormID: 001778E3	Dark00GeneralNPC	AdamusPhillidaTopic	0	He... He's dead. And on my watch... I've failed... Failed everyone...

FormID: 000C55C5	SQ01	SQ01Potatoes	0	Oh my goodness! You found them! Ohhhh! I could kiss you!	Excited and overjoyed
FormID: 000C55C5	SQ01	SQ01Potatoes	1	As promised, I owe you a reward for your efforts. I present you with my first batch of Famous Potato Bread! More valuable than gold! Enjoy!	
FormID: 0018885E	SQ01	SQ01Potatoes	0	My potatoes are like my children. I care for and nurture each one individually. That way, they grow up to be big and strong.	
FormID: 001885DB	SQ01	SQ01Potatoes	0	Please, you must help me find them! If I don't have them for the next batch of my Famous Potato Bread, I don't know what I'll do!	
FormID: 001885DB	SQ01	SQ01Potatoes	1	How stupid I was to leave them outside all alone like that! All I wanted to do was give them some sun. Next thing I knew, they were gone!	
FormID: 001885DB	SQ01	SQ01Potatoes	2	I saw someone running off to the west, but I'm too frightened to journey into the woods alone. Please... can you help me? I'll pay you well, I swear!	
FormID: 0018917C	SQ02	SQ02Skooma	0	You've done it! I can't even begin to thank you enough.	
FormID: 0018917C	SQ02	SQ02Skooma	1	By the Divines, I salute you in the name of the Legion. Here is your well-earned reward.	
FormID: 0018917D	SQ02	SQ02Skooma	0	Don't turn your back on Lonavo for a second. He wouldn't think twice about burying his blade there.	
FormID: 00189180	SQ02	SQ02Skooma	0	A small group of Skooma dealers led by a Dunmer named Kylius Lonavo is holed up in the Greyland Settlement just up the road.	
FormID: 00189180	SQ02	SQ02Skooma	1	I've been trying to catch Lonavo for months, but every time I approach the place, his lookout sees me and he goes running.	
FormID: 00189180	SQ02	SQ02Skooma	2	I need someone to go in there and put a stop to those fetchers. I don't care what it takes. We must get that poison they're selling off the street.	
FormID: 00189180	SQ02	SQ02Skooma	3	Bring me Lonavo's ring as proof he's... been dealt with... and I'll give you the bounty on him.	REC
FormID: 00189D08	SQ03	SQ03Continue	0	I'll tell you how you can help.	
FormID: 00189D08	SQ03	SQ03Continue	1	Kill those things. Every last one of them! They destroyed eveything I hold dear!	
FormID: 00189D08	SQ03	SQ03Continue	2	In their greed, the creatures grabbed a Jade Amulet off of Kayleen's... body. Bring me back that amulet, so I may use it to remember her by.	
FormID: 00189CF9	SQ03	SQ03Avenge	0	Then it's finally done. The Goblins have paid with their blood, and my wife's brutal slaying is avenged.	
FormID: 00189CF9	SQ03	SQ03Avenge	1	You risked life and limb for a cause that wasn't your own. For that, I'm grateful. Please, accept these gems as a token of my gratitude.	
FormID: 00189CF9	SQ03	SQ03Avenge	2	They're all I have left of value, but you must have them. I insist.	
FormID: 00189CFC	SQ03	SQ03Avenge	0	But... this is amazing!	
FormID: 00189CFC	SQ03	SQ03Avenge	1	I haven't tasked you to bring the amulet back to me, and yet you have. I don't know which of the Divines sent you, but I appreciate what you've done.	
FormID: 00189CFC	SQ03	SQ03Avenge	2	Those Goblins in Exhausted Mine you got this from killed my poor wife while I was away from home. Now I have my vengeance.	
FormID: 00189CFC	SQ03	SQ03Avenge	3	And now you have a reward. Please, take it. It's everything I have left of value, but it's the least I can do.	
FormID: 00189D07	SQ03	SQ03Avenge	0	Barely a week ago, I left Harm's Folly to go buy supplies as I usually do once a month. What a fool I was to leave my wife alone.	
FormID: 00189D07	SQ03	SQ03Avenge	1	The Goblins must have been watching me, as they knew right when to strike. I could hear Kayleen's screams from far away.	
FormID: 00189D07	SQ03	SQ03Avenge	2	Those wretched beasts killed her! Filthy animals! Had I only been there to stop them!	
FormID: 0018A95D	SQ04	SQ04Continue	0	Well, if you must know, I've been studying the Welkynd Stones. Yes, the aquamarine colored crystals usually native to Ayleid ruins.	
FormID: 0018A95D	SQ04	SQ04Continue	1	It seems I'm the first to discover them growing in a natural cave. That's about all I can say about it.	
FormID: 0018A957	SQ04	SQ04Notes	0	Splendid... just splendid!	
FormID: 0018A957	SQ04	SQ04Notes	1	I'd almost feared that you'd never return. I'm glad to see I was incorrect.	
FormID: 0018A957	SQ04	SQ04Notes	2	As promised, I'd like to compensate you for your efforts.	
FormID: 0018A958	SQ04	SQ04Notes	0	You're a clever one.	
FormID: 0018A958	SQ04	SQ04Notes	1	I was hoping if someone came across my notes in that cave, they'd take the time to read them and trace me back to the Imperial Bridge Inn.	
FormID: 0018A958	SQ04	SQ04Notes	2	Being the first person to discover Welkynd Stones growing outside their natural environment, I was worried a rival researcher would snatch them.	
FormID: 0018A958	SQ04	SQ04Notes	3	Fortunately for me, you found them. Allow me to compensate you for the time it took you to travel here.	
FormID: 0018A95C	SQ04	SQ04Notes	0	I was doing some research in Bramblepoint Cave, and suddenly I was attacked. I grabbed everything I could and ran, but I fear I dropped my notes.	
FormID: 0018A95C	SQ04	SQ04Notes	1	Those notes are very important to me and represent ten years of my life. If you could recover them, I'd be sure to reward you appropriately.	
FormID: 0018ABD4	SQ05	SQ05RaelynntheGravefinder	0	I realize it's in poor taste to celebrate anyone's demise, but Raelynn was evil through-and-through. You've done the right thing.	
FormID: 0018ABD4	SQ05	SQ05RaelynntheGravefinder	1	I believe we had a contract. Here's my part.	
FormID: 0018ABD6	SQ05	SQ05RaelynntheGravefinder	0	A few months ago, that witch of a Necromancer decided to inhabit Moss Rock Cavern just north of my inn.	
FormID: 0018ABD6	SQ05	SQ05RaelynntheGravefinder	1	I don't know what she does in there; frankly, I don't want to know. However, I do know that after she arrived, the woods at night became unsafe.	
FormID: 0018ABD6	SQ05	SQ05RaelynntheGravefinder	2	I've seen undead of all types walking in the dark woods near the cave entrance. Now, this area's getting a bad reputation and my business has waned.	
FormID: 0018ABD6	SQ05	SQ05RaelynntheGravefinder	3	Every day, it seems the number of undead increase. If someone can get into the cave and kill Raelynn, maybe we can stem the tide.	
FormID: 0018ABD6	SQ05	SQ05RaelynntheGravefinder	4	Her death pays a handsome bounty. I hope you'll take advantage of the opportunity.	
FormID: 0018AD6A	NQDKvatchNPC	GoodbyeKvatch07	0	Gods. I don't even notice any more. I guess you can get used to anything.	
FormID: 0018AD68	NQDKvatchNPC	GoodbyeKvatch06	0	I know what you're talking about. I don't even try. I just keep going until I drop.	
FormID: 0018AD66	NQDKvatchNPC	GoodbyeKvatch05	0	I'm angry. I want to stay angry. That anger keeps me going.	
FormID: 0018AD64	NQDKvatchNPC	GoodbyeKvatch04	0	Don't forget. Camoran Usurper burned Kvatch, too. Kvatch was rebuilt from ruins once before, and she'll do it again.	
FormID: 0018AD62	NQDKvatchNPC	GoodbyeKvatch03	0	Don't give up. You're not alone. And the chapels and the Elder Council will help us. It just takes time.	
FormID: 0018AD60	NQDKvatchNPC	GoodbyeKvatch02	0	It's possible. Or maybe she got out, and she's looking for you, too?	
FormID: 0018AD5E	NQDKvatchNPC	GoodbyeKvatch01	0	I don't know. What could we have done to deserve this?	
FormID: 00026BC5	NQDGuard	GuardGoodbye	0	It's about time.	
FormID: 00026BC6	NQDGuard	GuardGoodbye	0	My feet are killing me.

FormID: 00026BD0	NQDGuard	GuardGoodbye	0	Good. I'm hungry.	
FormID: 0018AE7D	NQDGuard	ImperialPalace	0	This is where the Emperor lives, when there is one. The council meets on the first floor.	
FormID: 0018AE7D	NQDGuard	ImperialPalace	1	The first and second floors are public. All other parts of the palace are strictly off limits.	
FormID: 0018AFD5	SQ06	SQ06Bears	0	I can't believe it. 	
FormID: 0018AFD5	SQ06	SQ06Bears	1	You actually did it!	
FormID: 0018AFD5	SQ06	SQ06Bears	2	Well, I hope this will eventually drive them away. There may be a few stragglers, but I think this should do it.	
FormID: 0018AFD5	SQ06	SQ06Bears	3	Now, how about that reward I promised?	
FormID: 0018AFD6	SQ06	SQ06Bears	0	Let me see a fang.	
FormID: 0018AFD6	SQ06	SQ06Bears	1	Hmmm... good. This has to be from one of the beasts. Excellent. Soon, you'll have them on the run.	
FormID: 0018AFE0	SQ06	SQ06Bears	0	I've had attacks on my small flock of sheep lately. I was hoping that building a fence would solve the problem, but it hasn't helped at all.	
FormID: 0018AFE0	SQ06	SQ06Bears	1	Then, one day when I was just about to step outside, I saw the culprits. A group of West Weald Bears was dragging away a sheep carcass.	
FormID: 0018AFE0	SQ06	SQ06Bears	2	There's no way I can fight those ferocious beasts off on my own. If you could thin the population a bit, they would probably leave the area.	
FormID: 0018AFE0	SQ06	SQ06Bears	3	I'll tell you what. Kill six of the things, bring me their fangs as proof, and I'll reward you well. Please, you're my only hope.	
FormID: 0018B210	MQInfoGeneral	MQ00MythicDawnResponse	0	Bastards. If I ever got a hold of one of them, I'd put 'em in the fire, like the old days.	
FormID: 0018B211	MQInfoGeneral	MQ00MythicDawnResponse	0	I heard the same thing. I'm not sure I believe it though. I mean, who would be crazy enough to help the daedra invade Tamriel?	
FormID: 0018B20F	MQInfoGeneral	MQ00EmperorResponse	0	I just don't think about it. The Elder Council will take care of things. Sooner or later.	
FormID: 0018B20C	MQInfoGeneral	MQ00KvatchResponse	0	No. They were taken by surprise. I'm sure the Legion has everything under control.	
FormID: 0018B20D	MQInfoGeneral	MQ00KvatchResponse	0	I don't know... first the emperor and his sons murdered, now this... yet I fear that the worst is still to come.	
FormID: 0018B20E	MQInfoGeneral	MQ00KvatchResponse	0	I don't know. I hear that those Oblivion Gates are opening everywhere. They say the Legion is stretched to the limit across the Empire.

FormID: 0018BC2F	TrainingHeavyArmor	Gift	0	A gift, for me?	
FormID: 0018BC2F	TrainingHeavyArmor	Gift	1	Oh, my. This is from Pranal, isn't it? He's such a sweet man. I do enjoy his company, but I'm afraid I just don't have romantic feelings for him.	
FormID: 0018BC2F	TrainingHeavyArmor	Gift	2	Well, these are simply beautiful. Thank you so much. And there's no need to let him know that I know where they came from. You understand.	typo
FormID: 0018BC30	TrainingHeavyArmor	Gift	0	Ah, wonderful! I'm sure they'll make her happy. It's the least I can do; she's brought so much joy into my life, whether she knows it or not.	
FormID: 0018BC30	TrainingHeavyArmor	Gift	1	Thank you for indulging an old man's whims. Now, you wanted to learn something about Heavy Armor, didn't you? I think I can help.	
FormID: 0018BC31	TrainingHeavyArmor	Gift	0	Just give them to her; say they're from a friend. She doesn't need to know I'm the one responsible.	
FormID: 0018BC33	TrainingHeavyArmor	Gift	0	Ah, these look lovely. I'm sure she'll like them.	
FormID: 0018BC33	TrainingHeavyArmor	Gift	1	You just go give them to her. No need to let her know where they came from; it doesn't matter. So long as she's happy.	
FormID: 0018BC39	TrainingHeavyArmor	Gift	0	When you've got the silver pitcher and the four glasses, let me know. I can't wait to see the look on her face.	
FormID: 0018BC38	TrainingHeavyArmor	MaleneTopic	0	I'm no fool. I know she'd never be interested in an old man like me. It's enough just to be around her, to be in her company.	REC
FormID: 0018BC38	TrainingHeavyArmor	MaleneTopic	1	Well, if you're dead set on learning something from me, then how about you do a little something for me, first? Something for her, to be honest.	REC

FormID: 0018BC66	TrainingSecurity	Message	0	What?

FormID: 00068347	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk5	0	I... I'm glad you wanted to talk. You'll always have my sword, of course. But you have my ear as well. Anytime. As a friend.	
FormID: 00068348	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk5	0	In truth, I welcome the chance to talk. For I feel a kinship toward you I cannot explain. We are brothers, bound by duty and destiny.	
FormID: 00068349	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk5	0	Well, my friend, let's hope it doesn't come to that, hmm? We'll get through this together... as brothers.	
FormID: 0006834A	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk5	0	The darkest days surely lie ahead. But I know that the Blades will stand true for the Empire, as they always have.	
FormID: 0006834B	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk5	0	Only a fool would doubt the valor of the Blades, but I must ask the same of you. Do not doubt my valor, do not doubt my resolve. I will not fail you.	
FormID: 0018D7F6	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk4	0	What concerns one of us, concerns all of us. We are Blades, after all. 	
FormID: 0018D7F7	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk4	0	You know how it is. There are whispers in the halls of Cloud Ruler, as in any other place. But it matters not. The Blades stand united!	
FormID: 0018D7F8	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk4	0	We are one mind and one blade, of course.	
FormID: 0018D7F9	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk4	0	You know that no matter what happens, no matter what fate befalls us, together we honor the memory of Uriel Septim.	
FormID: 0018D7FA	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk4	0	The bond we share is unbreakable, is it not? The Blades are as one, on this and every other matter.	
FormID: 00067DC5	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk4	0	Please, there's no need to apologize. If anyone should be sorry, it's me. You're busy, and I'm distracting you from your work.	
FormID: 0006834C	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk4	0	You and the other Blades have extended me every courtesy. But please, don't forget, I'm just a man. I need the company of friends, like any other.	
FormID: 0006834D	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk4	0	No, my friend, it's all right. It's just that, being a Septim is much... lonelier than I could have imagined. Perhaps my father felt the same way.	
FormID: 0006834E	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk4	0	Darkness may be upon us all, but the people of the Empire -- my Empire -- are worth fighting for! I just wanted you to know... I won't let you down.	
FormID: 0006834F	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk4	0	If I may be so bold... you are the true Dragonborn, sir, there's no one here that doubts it. Any one of us would gladly die so that you may live.	
FormID: 00068350	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk4	0	I have trained my entire life for the crisis that is now upon us. When the moment comes, I will gladly lay down my life for the Empire!	
FormID: 00067DC6	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk4	0	Just know, that whatever you need, we will give gladly. Our hearts, our blades, our lives if need be. Long live the Septim bloodline!	
FormID: 0018D7F1	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk3	0	Hmmm. Yes, yes, I see your point. And the others feel the same way?	
FormID: 0018D7F2	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk3	0	There is much wisdom in your words, my friend. Have you discussed this with the others?	
FormID: 0018D7F3	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk3	0	I've come to value your judgement, and your experience. Your wisdom does us all a great service.	
FormID: 0018D7F4	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk3	0	We're all on edge, and for good reason. But we can't give in to panic. Let's deal with this together, as the Blades always have.	
FormID: 0018D7F5	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk3	0	This has been a concern of mine as well. And I take it the others, they're of the same mind?	
FormID: 00067DC4	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk3	0	Please forgive me, sir. The others and I, we're just... well, we're glad to have you here with us, sir. We just want to make sure you're safe.	
FormID: 00068351	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk3	0	[Sigh.] Look at me, acting the paranoid fool. I apologize, my lord. I meant no disrespect. My nerves are taut as a bowstring!	
FormID: 00068352	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk3	0	I'm sorry, sir. We're all a bit jumpy. What did you need?	embarrassed...realizes he overreacted
FormID: 00068353	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk3	0	Thank you for your kind words. I never knew my father, but he must have been proud to call the Blades his protectors. I know I am.	
FormID: 00068354	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk3	0	No matter what happens, you must know... You must all know, that I am eternally grateful for the service you Blades have provided. 	
FormID: 00068355	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk3	0	You do me too much honor. For who am I? The bastard heir of a dead Emperor.	
FormID: 0018D7E9	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk2	0	It's the Great Hall. Those high windows -- they're not nearly as secure as they should be. If an assassin or spy should gain entrance...	
FormID: 0018D7EA	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk2	0	It's Martin. His security, I mean. I'm just not sure we're doing enough. He is the last of the Septim line. His death would spell our doom.	
FormID: 0018D7EB	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk2	0	I can't stop thinking about... about the Emperor. We failed. We failed because we got complacent. We got arrogant. Now the Empire's paying the price.	
FormID: 0018D7EC	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk2	0	The Mythic Dawn. What do we really know about them? How far into the Empire have they infiltrated? They could have sympathizers... and spies.	
FormID: 0018D7ED	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk2	0	The plane of Oblivion. We know so little about it. What if the Daedra we've seen are only the beginning? I think we should prepare for the worst.	
FormID: 0018D7EE	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk2	0	Cloud Ruler Temple is home to the Blades, and has served us well. But I fear an assault. Mythic Dawn, Daedra... maybe both. We must be ready.	
FormID: 0018D7EF	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk2	0	Martin is safe, and the Temple is secure. But there's a storm brewing. I can feel it... feel it in my bones. The worst is yet to come, mark my words.	
FormID: 0018D7F0	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk2	0	The Empire has been saved, but the Septim bloodline, it's... it's broken. There is no Emperor. I can't help but feel a bit... obsolete.	
FormID: 00067DC3	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk2	0	Oh, for the love of Akatosh, would everyone just please calm down! I'm fine. And I don't need anything. I just... I just wanted to talk. That's all.	
FormID: 00068356	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk2	0	Ha ha ha ha ha! Well, no one could ever accuse you Blades of being lax, I'll give you that. No, there's no need for alarm. I just wanted to talk. 	
FormID: 00068357	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk2	0	No no no no... It's all right... Everything's fine. There's no cause for alarm, really. I only wanted to share a few words. With a friend. 	
FormID: 00068358	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk2	0	Of course, sire. I just wanted to let you know you're safe here, sir. Cloud Ruler is secure, and the Blades stand ready.	
FormID: 00068359	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk2	0	Sire... we failed your father. The shame we all carry... But we will not fail you!  History will not repeat itself, of this you have my solemn vow!	
FormID: 0006835A	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk2	0	Well... I just wanted to say how honored I am... How honored we all are... by your presence, I mean.	
FormID: 0018D7E3	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk1	0	Of course. What troubles you?	
FormID: 0018D7E4	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk1	0	Aye, Blademaiden. What's on your mind?	
FormID: 0018D7E5	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk1	0	Aye, Bladesman. What's on your mind?	
FormID: 0018D7E6	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk1	0	Please, speak freely.	
FormID: 0018D7E7	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk1	0	What do you need, comrade? My ear, my sword? Name it.	
FormID: 0018D7E8	BladesConvSystem	BladesTalk1	0	Are we not Blades, joined by battle and brotherhood? Need you even ask?	
FormID: 00067DC2	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk1	0	Of course, my lord. If there's anything you need, anything at all, just name it. Have you been threatened?	
FormID: 0006835B	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk1	0	Yes, sire. What is it you need? You're not in danger, are you? My sword is yours!	
FormID: 0006835C	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk1	0	Is everything all right, my lord? Has Cloud Ruler been breached? I told the others the Great Hall wasn't secure! Those damn high windows...	
FormID: 0006835D	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk1	0	[QUOTE]My lord[QUOTE]? That isn't necessary. I'm just a man. Just a citizen of the Empire, trying to do his duty. Just like you.	
FormID: 00067DC9	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk1	0	You may have as much of my time as you need, so long as you stop calling me [QUOTE]lord.[QUOTE] My name is Martin.	
FormID: 00067DCA	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk1	0	Please, Blade, say what you will, but let us forgo these absurd formalities. I am no [QUOTE]lord[QUOTE] yet. I would remain plain Martin for a while.	
FormID: 00068907	BladesMartinConvSystem	BladesTalk1	0	By all means. What do you need?	
FormID: 0018D92E	SQ08	ShadowbanishWine	0	Well, apparently the wine is so rare because it was only made in one tiny batch. It's the product of an alchemist who was also a vintner.	
FormID: 0018D92E	SQ08	ShadowbanishWine	1	Besides tasting incredible, the magic within the wine allows the imbiber to be gifted with Night Eye!	
FormID: 0018D92E	SQ08	ShadowbanishWine	2	The vintner made it special for the Legion soldiers posted at the forts when they were active long ago.	
FormID: 0018D92E	SQ08	ShadowbanishWine	3	It was perfect for keeping lookouts warm on cold nights and helping them see better in the dark. Clever, eh?	
FormID: 0018D925	SQFIN	SQ08Wine	0	You have more? Amazing! Well, as promised, your finder's fee once again.	
FormID: 0018D92A	SQFIN	SQ08Wine	0	If I'm to buy the wine from you, you need to have it with you.	
FormID: 0018D924	SQ08	SQ08Wine	0	I'm at a loss for words. You actually found six!	
FormID: 0018D924	SQ08	SQ08Wine	1	These will hold an honored place in my collection! I don't know what else to say but thank you.	
FormID: 0018D924	SQ08	SQ08Wine	2	Oh! I almost forgot. Here's your finder's fee. Worth every single coin, I assure you.	
FormID: 0018D924	SQ08	SQ08Wine	3	I'll tell you what else I'll do since you seem so resourceful. If you find any more bottles of the wine, I'll gladly pay you well for them.	
FormID: 0018D92B	SQ08	SQ08Wine	0	By the Divines! You found some? Fantastic!	
FormID: 0018D92B	SQ08	SQ08Wine	1	Hang onto it for now. I must have six before I'll be truly satisfied. Then I'll have more than anyone else in Cyrodiil!	
FormID: 0018D92D	SQ08	SQ08Wine	0	Yes actually, I'm quite fond of collecting all manners of wines from all over Tamriel.	
FormID: 0018D92D	SQ08	SQ08Wine	1	But one vintage continues to elude me; Shadowbanish Wine. How I'd love to add it to my collection.	
FormID: 0018D92D	SQ08	SQ08Wine	2	Say, that gives me an idea. You look like the adventuring type. If you can retrieve six bottles of Shadowbanish Wine, I'll gladly pay you well.	
FormID: 0018D92D	SQ08	SQ08Wine	3	All I know about them is that they're found in the many fort ruins scattered all over Cyrodiil.
